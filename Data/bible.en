The book of the generation of Jesus Christ , the son of David , the son of Abraham .
Abraham begat Isaac ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren ;
And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar ; and Phares begat Esrom ; and Esrom begat Aram ;
And Aram begat Aminadab ; and Aminadab begat Naasson ; and Naasson begat Salmon ;
And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab ; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth ; and Obed begat Jesse ;
And Jesse begat David the king ; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias ;
And Solomon begat Roboam ; and Roboam begat Abia ; and Abia begat Asa ;
And Asa begat Josaphat ; and Josaphat begat Joram ; and Joram begat Ozias ;
And Ozias begat Joatham ; and Joatham begat Achaz ; and Achaz begat Ezekias ;
And Ezekias begat Manasses ; and Manasses begat Amon ; and Amon begat Josias ;
And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren , about the time they were carried away to Babylon :
And after they were brought to Babylon , Jechonias begat Salathiel ; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel ;
And Zorobabel begat Abiud ; and Abiud begat Eliakim ; and Eliakim begat Azor ;
And Azor begat Sadoc ; and Sadoc begat Achim ; and Achim begat Eliud ;
And Eliud begat Eleazar ; and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ;
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary , of whom was born Jesus , who is called Christ .
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations ; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations ; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations .
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise : When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph , before they came together , she was found with child of the Holy Ghost .
Then Joseph her husband , being a just man , and not willing to make her a publick example , was minded to put her away privily .
But while he thought on these things , behold , the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream , saying , Joseph , thou son of David , fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife : for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost .
And she shall bring forth a son , and thou shalt call his name JESUS : for he shall save his people from their sins .
Now all this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying ,
Behold , a virgin shall be with child , and shall bring forth a son , and they shall call his name Emmanuel , which being interpreted is , God with us .
Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him , and took unto him his wife :
And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son : and he called his name JESUS .
Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king , behold , there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem ,
Saying , Where is he that is born King of the Jews ? for we have seen his star in the east , and are come to worship him .
When Herod the king had heard these things , he was troubled , and all Jerusalem with him .
And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together , he demanded of them where Christ should be born .
And they said unto him , In Bethlehem of Judaea : for thus it is written by the prophet ,
And thou Bethlehem , in the land of Juda , art not the least among the princes of Juda : for out of thee shall come a Governor , that shall rule my people Israel .
Then Herod , when he had privily called the wise men , enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared .
And he sent them to Bethlehem , and said , Go and search diligently for the young child ; and when ye have found him , bring me word again , that I may come and worship him also .
When they had heard the king , they departed ; and , lo , the star , which they saw in the east , went before them , till it came and stood over where the young child was .
When they saw the star , they rejoiced with exceeding great joy .
And when they were come into the house , they saw the young child with Mary his mother , and fell down , and worshipped him : and when they had opened their treasures , they presented unto him gifts ; gold , and frankincense and myrrh .
And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod , they departed into their own country another way .
And when they were departed , behold , the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream , saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and flee into Egypt , and be thou there until I bring thee word : for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him .
When he arose , he took the young child and his mother by night , and departed into Egypt :
And was there until the death of Herod : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet , saying , Out of Egypt have I called my son .
Then Herod , when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men , was exceeding wroth , and sent forth , and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem , and in all the coasts thereof , from two years old and under , according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men .
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet , saying ,
In Rama was there a voice heard , lamentation , and weeping , and great mourning , Rachel weeping for her children , and would not be comforted , because they are not .
But when Herod was dead , behold , an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ,
Saying , Arise , and take the young child and his mother , and go into the land of Israel : for they are dead which sought the young child ' s life .
And he arose , and took the young child and his mother , and came into the land of Israel .
But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod , he was afraid to go thither : notwithstanding , being warned of God in a dream , he turned aside into the parts of Galilee :
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets , He shall be called a Nazarene .
In those days came John the Baptist , preaching in the wilderness of Judaea ,
And saying , Repent ye : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
And the same John had his raiment of camel ' s hair , and a leathern girdle about his loins ; and his meat was locusts and wild honey .
Then went out to him Jerusalem , and all Judaea , and all the region round about Jordan ,
And were baptized of him in Jordan , confessing their sins .
But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism , he said unto them , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance :
And think not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance : but he that cometh after me is mightier than I , whose shoes I am not worthy to bear : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost , and with fire :
Whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and gather his wheat into the garner ; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire .
Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John , to be baptized of him .
But John forbad him , saying , I have need to be baptized of thee , and comest thou to me ?
And Jesus answering said unto him , Suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness . Then he suffered him .
And Jesus , when he was baptized , went up straightway out of the water : and , lo , the heavens were opened unto him , and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove , and lighting upon him :
And lo a voice from heaven , saying , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil .
And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights , he was afterward an hungred .
And when the tempter came to him , he said , If thou be the Son of God , command that these stones be made bread .
But he answered and said , It is written , Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God .
Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city , and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple ,
And saith unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down : for it is written , He shall give his angels charge concerning thee : and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
Jesus said unto him , It is written again , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
Again , the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of them ;
And saith unto him , All these things will I give thee , if thou wilt fall down and worship me .
Then saith Jesus unto him , Get thee hence , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
Then the devil leaveth him , and , behold , angels came and ministered unto him .
Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison , he departed into Galilee ;
And leaving Nazareth , he came and dwelt in Capernaum , which is upon the sea coast , in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim :
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying ,
The land of Zabulon , and the land of Nephthalim , by the way of the sea , beyond Jordan , Galilee of the Gentiles ;
The people which sat in darkness saw great light ; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up .
From that time Jesus began to preach , and to say , Repent : for the kingdom of heaven is at hand .
And Jesus , walking by the sea of Galilee , saw two brethren , Simon called Peter , and Andrew his brother , casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
And he saith unto them , Follow me , and I will make you fishers of men .
And they straightway left their nets , and followed him .
And going on from thence , he saw other two brethren , James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , in a ship with Zebedee their father , mending their nets ; and he called them .
And they immediately left the ship and their father , and followed him .
And Jesus went about all Galilee , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people .
And his fame went throughout all Syria : and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments , and those which were possessed with devils , and those which were lunatick , and those that had the palsy ; and he healed them .
And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee , and from Decapolis , and from Jerusalem , and from Judaea , and from beyond Jordan .
And seeing the multitudes , he went up into a mountain : and when he was set , his disciples came unto him :
And he opened his mouth , and taught them , saying ,
Blessed are the poor in spirit : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
Blessed are they that mourn : for they shall be comforted .
Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth .
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness : for they shall be filled .
Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mercy .
Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see God .
Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called the children of God .
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness ' sake : for theirs is the kingdom of heaven .
Blessed are ye , when men shall revile you , and persecute you , and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely , for my sake .
Rejoice , and be exceeding glad : for great is your reward in heaven : for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you .
Ye are the salt of the earth : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be salted ? it is thenceforth good for nothing , but to be cast out , and to be trodden under foot of men .
Ye are the light of the world . A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid .
Neither do men light a candle , and put it under a bushel , but on a candlestick ; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house .
Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works , and glorify your Father which is in heaven .
Think not that I am come to destroy the law , or the prophets : I am not come to destroy , but to fulfil .
For verily I say unto you , Till heaven and earth pass , one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law , till all be fulfilled .
Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments , and shall teach men so , he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them , the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven .
For I say unto you , That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees , ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven .
Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time , Thou shalt not kill ; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment :
But I say unto you , That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment : and whosoever shall say to his brother , Raca , shall be in danger of the council : but whosoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire .
Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar , and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee ;
Leave there thy gift before the altar , and go thy way ; first be reconciled to thy brother , and then come and offer thy gift .
Agree with thine adversary quickly , whiles thou art in the way with him ; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and thou be cast into prison .
Verily I say unto thee , Thou shalt by no means come out thence , till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing .
Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time , Thou shalt not commit adultery :
But I say unto you , That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart .
And if thy right eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
And if thy right hand offend thee , cut it off , and cast it from thee : for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish , and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell .
It hath been said , Whosoever shall put away his wife , let him give her a writing of divorcement :
But I say unto you , That whosoever shall put away his wife , saving for the cause of fornication , causeth her to commit adultery : and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery .
Again , ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time , Thou shalt not forswear thyself , but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths :
But I say unto you , Swear not at all ; neither by heaven ; for it is God ' s throne :
Nor by the earth ; for it is his footstool : neither by Jerusalem ; for it is the city of the great King .
Neither shalt thou swear by thy head , because thou canst not make one hair white or black .
But let your communication be , Yea , yea ; Nay , nay : for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil .
Ye have heard that it hath been said , An eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth :
But I say unto you , That ye resist not evil : but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also .
And if any man will sue thee at the law , and take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also .
And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile , go with him twain .
Give to him that asketh thee , and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away .
Ye have heard that it hath been said , Thou shalt love thy neighbour , and hate thine enemy .
But I say unto you , Love your enemies , bless them that curse you , do good to them that hate you , and pray for them which despitefully use you , and persecute you ;
That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven : for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust .
For if ye love them which love you , what reward have ye ? do not even the publicans the same ?
And if ye salute your brethren only , what do ye more than others ? do not even the publicans so ?
Be ye therefore perfect , even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect .
Take heed that ye do not your alms before men , to be seen of them : otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven .
Therefore when thou doest thine alms , do not sound a trumpet before thee , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may have glory of men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
But when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth :
That thine alms may be in secret : and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly .
And when thou prayest , thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are : for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets , that they may be seen of men . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
But thou , when thou prayest , enter into thy closet , and when thou hast shut thy door , pray to thy Father which is in secret ; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly .
But when ye pray , use not vain repetitions , as the heathen do : for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking .
Be not ye therefore like unto them : for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of , before ye ask him .
After this manner therefore pray ye : Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name .
Thy kingdom come , Thy will be done in earth , as it is in heaven .
Give us this day our daily bread .
And forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors .
And lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil : For thine is the kingdom , and the power , and the glory , for ever . Amen .
For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you :
But if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses .
Moreover when ye fast , be not , as the hypocrites , of a sad countenance : for they disfigure their faces , that they may appear unto men to fast . Verily I say unto you , They have their reward .
But thou , when thou fastest , anoint thine head , and wash thy face ;
That thou appear not unto men to fast , but unto thy Father which is in secret : and thy Father , which seeth in secret , shall reward thee openly .
Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth , where moth and rust doth corrupt , and where thieves break through and steal :
But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven , where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt , and where thieves do not break through nor steal :
For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
The light of the body is the eye : if therefore thine eye be single , thy whole body shall be full of light .
But if thine eye be evil , thy whole body shall be full of darkness . If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness , how great is that darkness !
No man can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye cannot serve God and mammon .
Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink ; nor yet for your body , what ye shall put on . Is not the life more than meat , and the body than raiment ?
Behold the fowls of the air : for they sow not , neither do they reap , nor gather into barns ; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them . Are ye not much better than they ?
Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature ?
And why take ye thought for raiment ? Consider the lilies of the field , how they grow ; they toil not , neither do they spin :
And yet I say unto you , That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
Wherefore , if God so clothe the grass of the field , which to day is , and to morrow is cast into the oven , shall he not much more clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
Therefore take no thought , saying , What shall we eat ? or , What shall we drink ? or , Wherewithal shall we be clothed ?
( For after all these things do the Gentiles seek : ) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things .
But seek ye first the kingdom of God , and his righteousness ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
Take therefore no thought for the morrow : for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself . Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof .
Judge not , that ye be not judged .
For with what judgment ye judge , ye shall be judged : and with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you again .
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ' s eye , but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother , Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye ; and , behold , a beam is in thine own eye ?
Thou hypocrite , first cast out the beam out of thine own eye ; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother ' s eye .
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine , lest they trample them under their feet , and turn again and rend you .
Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you :
For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
Or what man is there of you , whom if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ?
Or if he ask a fish , will he give him a serpent ?
If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children , how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him ?
Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them : for this is the law and the prophets .
Enter ye in at the strait gate : for wide is the gate , and broad is the way , that leadeth to destruction , and many there be which go in thereat :
Because strait is the gate , and narrow is the way , which leadeth unto life , and few there be that find it .
Beware of false prophets , which come to you in sheep ' s clothing , but inwardly they are ravening wolves .
Ye shall know them by their fruits . Do men gather grapes of thorns , or figs of thistles ?
Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit ; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit .
A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit , neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them .
Not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven .
Many will say to me in that day , Lord , Lord , have we not prophesied in thy name ? and in thy name have cast out devils ? and in thy name done many wonderful works ?
And then will I profess unto them , I never knew you : depart from me , ye that work iniquity .
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them , I will liken him unto a wise man , which built his house upon a rock :
And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell not : for it was founded upon a rock .
And every one that heareth these sayings of mine , and doeth them not , shall be likened unto a foolish man , which built his house upon the sand :
And the rain descended , and the floods came , and the winds blew , and beat upon that house ; and it fell : and great was the fall of it .
And it came to pass , when Jesus had ended these sayings , the people were astonished at his doctrine :
For he taught them as one having authority , and not as the scribes .
When he was come down from the mountain , great multitudes followed him .
And , behold , there came a leper and worshipped him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
And Jesus put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will ; be thou clean . And immediately his leprosy was cleansed .
And Jesus saith unto him , See thou tell no man ; but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer the gift that Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum , there came unto him a centurion , beseeching him ,
And saying , Lord , my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy , grievously tormented .
And Jesus saith unto him , I will come and heal him .
The centurion answered and said , Lord , I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof : but speak the word only , and my servant shall be healed .
For I am a man under authority , having soldiers under me : and I say to this man , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
When Jesus heard it , he marvelled , and said to them that followed , Verily I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
And I say unto you , That many shall come from the east and west , and shall sit down with Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , in the kingdom of heaven .
But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
And Jesus said unto the centurion , Go thy way ; and as thou hast believed , so be it done unto thee . And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour .
And when Jesus was come into Peter ' s house , he saw his wife ' s mother laid , and sick of a fever .
And he touched her hand , and the fever left her : and she arose , and ministered unto them .
When the even was come , they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils : and he cast out the spirits with his word , and healed all that were sick :
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying , Himself took our infirmities , and bare our sicknesses .
Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him , he gave commandment to depart unto the other side .
And a certain scribe came , and said unto him , Master , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
And Jesus saith unto him , The foxes have holes , and the birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
And another of his disciples said unto him , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
But Jesus said unto him , Follow me ; and let the dead bury their dead .
And when he was entered into a ship , his disciples followed him .
And , behold , there arose a great tempest in the sea , insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves : but he was asleep .
And his disciples came to him , and awoke him , saying , Lord , save us : we perish .
And he saith unto them , Why are ye fearful , O ye of little faith ? Then he arose , and rebuked the winds and the sea ; and there was a great calm .
But the men marvelled , saying , What manner of man is this , that even the winds and the sea obey him !
And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes , there met him two possessed with devils , coming out of the tombs , exceeding fierce , so that no man might pass by that way .
And , behold , they cried out , saying , What have we to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God ? art thou come hither to torment us before the time ?
And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding .
So the devils besought him , saying , If thou cast us out , suffer us to go away into the herd of swine .
And he said unto them , Go . And when they were come out , they went into the herd of swine : and , behold , the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea , and perished in the waters .
And they that kept them fled , and went their ways into the city , and told every thing , and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils .
And , behold , the whole city came out to meet Jesus : and when they saw him , they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts .
And he entered into a ship , and passed over , and came into his own city .
And , behold , they brought to him a man sick of the palsy , lying on a bed : and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy ; Son , be of good cheer ; thy sins be forgiven thee .
And , behold , certain of the scribes said within themselves , This man blasphemeth .
And Jesus knowing their thoughts said , Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts ?
For whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and walk ?
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( then saith he to the sick of the palsy , ) Arise , take up thy bed , and go unto thine house .
And he arose , and departed to his house .
But when the multitudes saw it , they marvelled , and glorified God , which had given such power unto men .
And as Jesus passed forth from thence , he saw a man , named Matthew , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he saith unto him , Follow me . And he arose , and followed him .
And it came to pass , as Jesus sat at meat in the house , behold , many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples .
And when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto his disciples , Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners ?
But when Jesus heard that , he said unto them , They that be whole need not a physician , but they that are sick .
But go ye and learn what that meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice : for I am not come to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
Then came to him the disciples of John , saying , Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft , but thy disciples fast not ?
And Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber mourn , as long as the bridegroom is with them ? but the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken from them , and then shall they fast .
No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment , for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment , and the rent is made worse .
Neither do men put new wine into old bottles : else the bottles break , and the wine runneth out , and the bottles perish : but they put new wine into new bottles , and both are preserved .
While he spake these things unto them , behold , there came a certain ruler , and worshipped him , saying , My daughter is even now dead : but come and lay thy hand upon her , and she shall live .
And Jesus arose , and followed him , and so did his disciples .
And , behold , a woman , which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years , came behind him , and touched the hem of his garment :
For she said within herself , If I may but touch his garment , I shall be whole .
But Jesus turned him about , and when he saw her , he said , Daughter , be of good comfort ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And the woman was made whole from that hour .
And when Jesus came into the ruler ' s house , and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise ,
He said unto them , Give place : for the maid is not dead , but sleepeth . And they laughed him to scorn .
But when the people were put forth , he went in , and took her by the hand , and the maid arose .
And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land .
And when Jesus departed thence , two blind men followed him , crying , and saying , Thou son of David , have mercy on us .
And when he was come into the house , the blind men came to him : and Jesus saith unto them , Believe ye that I am able to do this ? They said unto him , Yea , Lord .
Then touched he their eyes , saying , According to your faith be it unto you .
And their eyes were opened ; and Jesus straitly charged them , saying , See that no man know it .
But they , when they were departed , spread abroad his fame in all that country .
As they went out , behold , they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil .
And when the devil was cast out , the dumb spake : and the multitudes marvelled , saying , It was never so seen in Israel .
But the Pharisees said , He casteth out devils through the prince of the devils .
And Jesus went about all the cities and villages , teaching in their synagogues , and preaching the gospel of the kingdom , and healing every sickness and every disease among the people .
But when he saw the multitudes , he was moved with compassion on them , because they fainted , and were scattered abroad , as sheep having no shepherd .
Then saith he unto his disciples , The harvest truly is plenteous , but the labourers are few ;
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he will send forth labourers into his harvest .
And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples , he gave them power against unclean spirits , to cast them out , and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease .
Now the names of the twelve apostles are these ; The first , Simon , who is called Peter , and Andrew his brother ; James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother ;
Philip , and Bartholomew ; Thomas , and Matthew the publican ; James the son of Alphaeus , and Lebbaeus , whose surname was Thaddaeus ;
Simon the Canaanite , and Judas Iscariot , who also betrayed him .
These twelve Jesus sent forth , and commanded them , saying , Go not into the way of the Gentiles , and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not :
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
And as ye go , preach , saying , The kingdom of heaven is at hand .
Heal the sick , cleanse the lepers , raise the dead , cast out devils : freely ye have received , freely give .
Provide neither gold , nor silver , nor brass in your purses ,
Nor scrip for your journey , neither two coats , neither shoes , nor yet staves : for the workman is worthy of his meat .
And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter , enquire who in it is worthy ; and there abide till ye go thence .
And when ye come into an house , salute it .
And if the house be worthy , let your peace come upon it : but if it be not worthy , let your peace return to you .
And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear your words , when ye depart out of that house or city , shake off the dust of your feet .
Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
Behold , I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves : be ye therefore wise as serpents , and harmless as doves .
But beware of men : for they will deliver you up to the councils , and they will scourge you in their synagogues ;
And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them and the Gentiles .
But when they deliver you up , take no thought how or what ye shall speak : for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak .
For it is not ye that speak , but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you .
And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death , and the father the child : and the children shall rise up against their parents , and cause them to be put to death .
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ' s sake : but he that endureth to the end shall be saved .
But when they persecute you in this city , flee ye into another : for verily I say unto you , Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel , till the Son of man be come .
The disciple is not above his master , nor the servant above his lord .
It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master , and the servant as his lord . If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub , how much more shall they call them of his household ?
Fear them not therefore : for there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; and hid , that shall not be known .
What I tell you in darkness , that speak ye in light : and what ye hear in the ear , that preach ye upon the housetops .
And fear not them which kill the body , but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell .
Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing ? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father .
But the very hairs of your head are all numbered .
Fear ye not therefore , ye are of more value than many sparrows .
Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men , him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven .
But whosoever shall deny me before men , him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven .
Think not that I am come to send peace on earth : I came not to send peace , but a sword .
For I am come to set a man at variance against his father , and the daughter against her mother , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
And a man ' s foes shall be they of his own household .
He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me : and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me .
And he that taketh not his cross , and followeth after me , is not worthy of me .
He that findeth his life shall lose it : and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it .
He that receiveth you receiveth me , and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet ' s reward ; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man ' s reward .
And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple , verily I say unto you , he shall in no wise lose his reward .
And it came to pass , when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples , he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities .
Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ , he sent two of his disciples ,
And said unto him , Art thou he that should come , or do we look for another ?
Jesus answered and said unto them , Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and see :
The blind receive their sight , and the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , and the deaf hear , the dead are raised up , and the poor have the gospel preached to them .
And blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
And as they departed , Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? behold , they that wear soft clothing are in kings ' houses .
But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? yea , I say unto you , and more than a prophet .
For this is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
Verily I say unto you , Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist : notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he .
And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence , and the violent take it by force .
For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John .
And if ye will receive it , this is Elias , which was for to come .
He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
But whereunto shall I liken this generation ? It is like unto children sitting in the markets , and calling unto their fellows ,
And saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned unto you , and ye have not lamented .
For John came neither eating nor drinking , and they say , He hath a devil .
The Son of man came eating and drinking , and they say , Behold a man gluttonous , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners . But wisdom is justified of her children .
Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done , because they repented not :
Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works , which were done in you , had been done in Tyre and Sidon , they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes .
But I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment , than for you .
And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted unto heaven , shalt be brought down to hell : for if the mighty works , which have been done in thee , had been done in Sodom , it would have remained until this day .
But I say unto you , That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment , than for thee .
At that time Jesus answered and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes .
Even so , Father : for so it seemed good in thy sight .
All things are delivered unto me of my Father : and no man knoweth the Son , but the Father ; neither knoweth any man the Father , save the Son , and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him .
Come unto me , all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest .
Take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light .
At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn ; and his disciples were an hungred , and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat .
But when the Pharisees saw it , they said unto him , Behold , thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day .
But he said unto them , Have ye not read what David did , when he was an hungred , and they that were with him ;
How he entered into the house of God , and did eat the shewbread , which was not lawful for him to eat , neither for them which were with him , but only for the priests ?
Or have ye not read in the law , how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath , and are blameless ?
But I say unto you , That in this place is one greater than the temple .
But if ye had known what this meaneth , I will have mercy , and not sacrifice , ye would not have condemned the guiltless .
For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day .
And when he was departed thence , he went into their synagogue :
And , behold , there was a man which had his hand withered . And they asked him , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days ? that they might accuse him .
And he said unto them , What man shall there be among you , that shall have one sheep , and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day , will he not lay hold on it , and lift it out ?
How much then is a man better than a sheep ? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days .
Then saith he to the man , Stretch forth thine hand . And he stretched it forth ; and it was restored whole , like as the other .
Then the Pharisees went out , and held a council against him , how they might destroy him .
But when Jesus knew it , he withdrew himself from thence : and great multitudes followed him , and he healed them all ;
And charged them that they should not make him known :
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet , saying ,
Behold my servant , whom I have chosen ; my beloved , in whom my soul is well pleased : I will put my spirit upon him , and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles .
He shall not strive , nor cry ; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets .
A bruised reed shall he not break , and smoking flax shall he not quench , till he send forth judgment unto victory .
And in his name shall the Gentiles trust .
Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil , blind , and dumb : and he healed him , insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw .
And all the people were amazed , and said , Is not this the son of David ?
But when the Pharisees heard it , they said , This fellow doth not cast out devils , but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils .
And Jesus knew their thoughts , and said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand :
And if Satan cast out Satan , he is divided against himself ; how shall then his kingdom stand ?
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your children cast them out ? therefore they shall be your judges .
But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God , then the kingdom of God is come unto you .
Or else how can one enter into a strong man ' s house , and spoil his goods , except he first bind the strong man ? and then he will spoil his house .
He that is not with me is against me ; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad .
Wherefore I say unto you , All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men : but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men .
And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost , it shall not be forgiven him , neither in this world , neither in the world to come .
Either make the tree good , and his fruit good ; or else make the tree corrupt , and his fruit corrupt : for the tree is known by his fruit .
O generation of vipers , how can ye , being evil , speak good things ? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh .
A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things : and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things .
But I say unto you , That every idle word that men shall speak , they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .
For by thy words thou shalt be justified , and by thy words thou shalt be condemned .
Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered , saying , Master , we would see a sign from thee .
But he answered and said unto them , An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given to it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas :
For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale ' s belly ; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth .
The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : because they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest , and findeth none .
Then he saith , I will return into my house from whence I came out ; and when he is come , he findeth it empty , swept , and garnished .
Then goeth he , and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself , and they enter in and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first . Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation .
While he yet talked to the people , behold , his mother and his brethren stood without , desiring to speak with him .
Then one said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to speak with thee .
But he answered and said unto him that told him , Who is my mother ? and who are my brethren ?
And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren !
For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven , the same is my brother , and sister , and mother .
The same day went Jesus out of the house , and sat by the sea side .
And great multitudes were gathered together unto him , so that he went into a ship , and sat ; and the whole multitude stood on the shore .
And he spake many things unto them in parables , saying , Behold , a sower went forth to sow ;
And when he sowed , some seeds fell by the way side , and the fowls came and devoured them up :
Some fell upon stony places , where they had not much earth : and forthwith they sprung up , because they had no deepness of earth :
And when the sun was up , they were scorched ; and because they had no root , they withered away .
And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprung up , and choked them :
But other fell into good ground , and brought forth fruit , some an hundredfold , some sixtyfold , some thirtyfold .
Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
And the disciples came , and said unto him , Why speakest thou unto them in parables ?
He answered and said unto them , Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven , but to them it is not given .
For whosoever hath , to him shall be given , and he shall have more abundance : but whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken away even that he hath .
Therefore speak I to them in parables : because they seeing see not ; and hearing they hear not , neither do they understand .
And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias , which saith , By hearing ye shall hear , and shall not understand ; and seeing ye shall see , and shall not perceive :
For this people ' s heart is waxed gross , and their ears are dull of hearing , and their eyes they have closed ; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears , and should understand with their heart , and should be converted , and I should heal them .
But blessed are your eyes , for they see : and your ears , for they hear .
For verily I say unto you , That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower .
When any one heareth the word of the kingdom , and understandeth it not , then cometh the wicked one , and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart . This is he which received seed by the way side .
But he that received the seed into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word , and anon with joy receiveth it ;
Yet hath he not root in himself , but dureth for a while : for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word , by and by he is offended .
He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word ; and the care of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , choke the word , and he becometh unfruitful .
But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word , and understandeth it ; which also beareth fruit , and bringeth forth , some an hundredfold , some sixty , some thirty .
Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field :
But while men slept , his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat , and went his way .
But when the blade was sprung up , and brought forth fruit , then appeared the tares also .
So the servants of the householder came and said unto him , Sir , didst not thou sow good seed in thy field ? from whence then hath it tares ?
He said unto them , An enemy hath done this . The servants said unto him , Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up ?
But he said , Nay ; lest while ye gather up the tares , ye root up also the wheat with them .
Let both grow together until the harvest : and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers , Gather ye together first the tares , and bind them in bundles to burn them : but gather the wheat into my barn .
Another parable put he forth unto them , saying , The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and sowed in his field :
Which indeed is the least of all seeds : but when it is grown , it is the greatest among herbs , and becometh a tree , so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof .
Another parable spake he unto them ; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven , which a woman took , and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables ; and without a parable spake he not unto them :
That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying , I will open my mouth in parables ; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world .
Then Jesus sent the multitude away , and went into the house : and his disciples came unto him , saying , Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field .
He answered and said unto them , He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man ;
The field is the world ; the good seed are the children of the kingdom ; but the tares are the children of the wicked one ;
The enemy that sowed them is the devil ; the harvest is the end of the world ; and the reapers are the angels .
As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire ; so shall it be in the end of this world .
The Son of man shall send forth his angels , and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend , and them which do iniquity ;
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father . Who hath ears to hear , let him hear .
Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field ; the which when a man hath found , he hideth , and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath , and buyeth that field .
Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man , seeking goodly pearls :
Who , when he had found one pearl of great price , went and sold all that he had , and bought it .
Again , the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net , that was cast into the sea , and gathered of every kind :
Which , when it was full , they drew to shore , and sat down , and gathered the good into vessels , but cast the bad away .
So shall it be at the end of the world : the angels shall come forth , and sever the wicked from among the just ,
And shall cast them into the furnace of fire : there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth .
Jesus saith unto them , Have ye understood all these things ? They say unto him , Yea , Lord .
Then said he unto them , Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old .
And it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these parables , he departed thence .
And when he was come into his own country , he taught them in their synagogue , insomuch that they were astonished , and said , Whence hath this man this wisdom , and these mighty works ?
Is not this the carpenter ' s son ? is not his mother called Mary ? and his brethren , James , and Joses , and Simon , and Judas ?
And his sisters , are they not all with us ? Whence then hath this man all these things ?
And they were offended in him . But Jesus said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , save in his own country , and in his own house .
And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief .
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus ,
And said unto his servants , This is John the Baptist ; he is risen from the dead ; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
For Herod had laid hold on John , and bound him , and put him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip ' s wife .
For John said unto him , It is not lawful for thee to have her .
And when he would have put him to death , he feared the multitude , because they counted him as a prophet .
But when Herod ' s birthday was kept , the daughter of Herodias danced before them , and pleased Herod .
Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask .
And she , being before instructed of her mother , said , Give me here John Baptist ' s head in a charger .
And the king was sorry : nevertheless for the oath ' s sake , and them which sat with him at meat , he commanded it to be given her .
And he sent , and beheaded John in the prison .
And his head was brought in a charger , and given to the damsel : and she brought it to her mother .
And his disciples came , and took up the body , and buried it , and went and told Jesus .
When Jesus heard of it , he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart : and when the people had heard thereof , they followed him on foot out of the cities .
And Jesus went forth , and saw a great multitude , and was moved with compassion toward them , and he healed their sick .
And when it was evening , his disciples came to him , saying , This is a desert place , and the time is now past ; send the multitude away , that they may go into the villages , and buy themselves victuals .
But Jesus said unto them , They need not depart ; give ye them to eat .
And they say unto him , We have here but five loaves , and two fishes .
He said , Bring them hither to me .
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass , and took the five loaves , and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed , and brake , and gave the loaves to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full .
And they that had eaten were about five thousand men , beside women and children .
And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship , and to go before him unto the other side , while he sent the multitudes away .
And when he had sent the multitudes away , he went up into a mountain apart to pray : and when the evening was come , he was there alone .
But the ship was now in the midst of the sea , tossed with waves : for the wind was contrary .
And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them , walking on the sea .
And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea , they were troubled , saying , It is a spirit ; and they cried out for fear .
But straightway Jesus spake unto them , saying , Be of good cheer ; it is I ; be not afraid .
And Peter answered him and said , Lord , if it be thou , bid me come unto thee on the water .
And he said , Come . And when Peter was come down out of the ship , he walked on the water , to go to Jesus .
But when he saw the wind boisterous , he was afraid ; and beginning to sink , he cried , saying , Lord , save me .
And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand , and caught him , and said unto him , O thou of little faith , wherefore didst thou doubt ?
And when they were come into the ship , the wind ceased .
Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him , saying , Of a truth thou art the Son of God .
And when they were gone over , they came into the land of Gennesaret .
And when the men of that place had knowledge of him , they sent out into all that country round about , and brought unto him all that were diseased ;
And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment : and as many as touched were made perfectly whole .
Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees , which were of Jerusalem , saying ,
Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders ? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread .
But he answered and said unto them , Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition ?
For God commanded , saying , Honour thy father and mother : and , He that curseth father or mother , let him die the death .
But ye say , Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother , It is a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ;
And honour not his father or his mother , he shall be free . Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition .
Ye hypocrites , well did Esaias prophesy of you , saying ,
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth , and honoureth me with their lips ; but their heart is far from me .
But in vain they do worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
And he called the multitude , and said unto them , Hear , and understand :
Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man ; but that which cometh out of the mouth , this defileth a man .
Then came his disciples , and said unto him , Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended , after they heard this saying ?
But he answered and said , Every plant , which my heavenly Father hath not planted , shall be rooted up .
Let them alone : they be blind leaders of the blind . And if the blind lead the blind , both shall fall into the ditch .
Then answered Peter and said unto him , Declare unto us this parable .
And Jesus said , Are ye also yet without understanding ?
Do not ye yet understand , that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly , and is cast out into the draught ?
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart ; and they defile the man .
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts , murders , adulteries , fornications , thefts , false witness , blasphemies :
These are the things which defile a man : but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man .
Then Jesus went thence , and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon .
And , behold , a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts , and cried unto him , saying , Have mercy on me , O Lord , thou son of David ; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil .
But he answered her not a word . And his disciples came and besought him , saying , Send her away ; for she crieth after us .
But he answered and said , I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel .
Then came she and worshipped him , saying , Lord , help me .
But he answered and said , It is not meet to take the children ' s bread , and to cast it to dogs .
And she said , Truth , Lord : yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters ' table .
Then Jesus answered and said unto her , O woman , great is thy faith : be it unto thee even as thou wilt . And her daughter was made whole from that very hour .
And Jesus departed from thence , and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee ; and went up into a mountain , and sat down there .
And great multitudes came unto him , having with them those that were lame , blind , dumb , maimed , and many others , and cast them down at Jesus ' feet ; and he healed them :
Insomuch that the multitude wondered , when they saw the dumb to speak , the maimed to be whole , the lame to walk , and the blind to see : and they glorified the God of Israel .
Then Jesus called his disciples unto him , and said , I have compassion on the multitude , because they continue with me now three days , and have nothing to eat : and I will not send them away fasting , lest they faint in the way .
And his disciples say unto him , Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness , as to fill so great a multitude ?
And Jesus saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven , and a few little fishes .
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground .
And he took the seven loaves and the fishes , and gave thanks , and brake them , and gave to his disciples , and the disciples to the multitude .
And they did all eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full .
And they that did eat were four thousand men , beside women and children .
And he sent away the multitude , and took ship , and came into the coasts of Magdala .
The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came , and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven .
He answered and said unto them , When it is evening , ye say , It will be fair weather : for the sky is red .
And in the morning , It will be foul weather to day : for the sky is red and lowering . O ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky ; but can ye not discern the signs of the times ?
A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign ; and there shall no sign be given unto it , but the sign of the prophet Jonas . And he left them , and departed .
And when his disciples were come to the other side , they had forgotten to take bread .
Then Jesus said unto them , Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have taken no bread .
Which when Jesus perceived , he said unto them , O ye of little faith , why reason ye among yourselves , because ye have brought no bread ?
Do ye not yet understand , neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand , and how many baskets ye took up ?
How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread , that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees ?
Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread , but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees .
When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi , he asked his disciples , saying , Whom do men say that I the Son of man am ?
And they said , Some say that thou art John the Baptist : some , Elias ; and others , Jeremias , or one of the prophets .
He saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ?
And Simon Peter answered and said , Thou art the Christ , the Son of the living God .
And Jesus answered and said unto him , Blessed art thou , Simon Barjona : for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee , but my Father which is in heaven .
And I say also unto thee , That thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it .
And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ .
From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples , how that he must go unto Jerusalem , and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be killed , and be raised again the third day .
Then Peter took him , and began to rebuke him , saying , Be it far from thee , Lord : this shall not be unto thee .
But he turned , and said unto Peter , Get thee behind me , Satan : thou art an offence unto me : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but those that be of men .
Then said Jesus unto his disciples , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it .
For what is a man profited , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels ; and then he shall reward every man according to his works .
Verily I say unto you , There be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom .
And after six days Jesus taketh Peter , James , and John his brother , and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart ,
And was transfigured before them : and his face did shine as the sun , and his raiment was white as the light .
And , behold , there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him .
Then answered Peter , and said unto Jesus , Lord , it is good for us to be here : if thou wilt , let us make here three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
While he yet spake , behold , a bright cloud overshadowed them : and behold a voice out of the cloud , which said , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased ; hear ye him .
And when the disciples heard it , they fell on their face , and were sore afraid .
And Jesus came and touched them , and said , Arise , and be not afraid .
And when they had lifted up their eyes , they saw no man , save Jesus only .
And as they came down from the mountain , Jesus charged them , saying , Tell the vision to no man , until the Son of man be risen again from the dead .
And his disciples asked him , saying , Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come ?
And Jesus answered and said unto them , Elias truly shall first come , and restore all things .
But I say unto you , That Elias is come already , and they knew him not , but have done unto him whatsoever they listed . Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them .
Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist .
And when they were come to the multitude , there came to him a certain man , kneeling down to him , and saying ,
Lord , have mercy on my son : for he is lunatick , and sore vexed : for ofttimes he falleth into the fire , and oft into the water .
And I brought him to thy disciples , and they could not cure him .
Then Jesus answered and said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I suffer you ? bring him hither to me .
And Jesus rebuked the devil ; and he departed out of him : and the child was cured from that very hour .
Then came the disciples to Jesus apart , and said , Why could not we cast him out ?
And Jesus said unto them , Because of your unbelief : for verily I say unto you , If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye shall say unto this mountain , Remove hence to yonder place ; and it shall remove ; and nothing shall be impossible unto you .
Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting .
And while they abode in Galilee , Jesus said unto them , The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men :
And they shall kill him , and the third day he shall be raised again . And they were exceeding sorry .
And when they were come to Capernaum , they that received tribute money came to Peter , and said , Doth not your master pay tribute ?
He saith , Yes . And when he was come into the house , Jesus prevented him , saying , What thinkest thou , Simon ? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute ? of their own children , or of strangers ?
Peter saith unto him , Of strangers . Jesus saith unto him , Then are the children free .
Notwithstanding , lest we should offend them , go thou to the sea , and cast an hook , and take up the fish that first cometh up ; and when thou hast opened his mouth , thou shalt find a piece of money : that take , and give unto them for me and thee .
At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus , saying , Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven ?
And Jesus called a little child unto him , and set him in the midst of them ,
And said , Verily I say unto you , Except ye be converted , and become as little children , ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven .
Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child , the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me .
But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me , it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea .
Woe unto the world because of offences ! for it must needs be that offences come ; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh !
Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee , cut them off , and cast them from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed , rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire .
And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out , and cast it from thee : it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye , rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire .
Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones ; for I say unto you , That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven .
For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost .
How think ye ? if a man have an hundred sheep , and one of them be gone astray , doth he not leave the ninety and nine , and goeth into the mountains , and seeketh that which is gone astray ?
And if so be that he find it , verily I say unto you , he rejoiceth more of that sheep , than of the ninety and nine which went not astray .
Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven , that one of these little ones should perish .
Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee , go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone : if he shall hear thee , thou hast gained thy brother .
But if he will not hear thee , then take with thee one or two more , that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established .
And if he shall neglect to hear them , tell it unto the church : but if he neglect to hear the church , let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican .
Verily I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven : and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven .
Again I say unto you , That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask , it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven .
For where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am I in the midst of them .
Then came Peter to him , and said , Lord , how oft shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? till seven times ?
Jesus saith unto him , I say not unto thee , Until seven times : but , Until seventy times seven .
Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king , which would take account of his servants .
And when he had begun to reckon , one was brought unto him , which owed him ten thousand talents .
But forasmuch as he had not to pay , his lord commanded him to be sold , and his wife , and children , and all that he had , and payment to be made .
The servant therefore fell down , and worshipped him , saying , Lord , have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion , and loosed him , and forgave him the debt .
But the same servant went out , and found one of his fellowservants , which owed him an hundred pence : and he laid hands on him , and took him by the throat , saying , Pay me that thou owest .
And his fellowservant fell down at his feet , and besought him , saying , Have patience with me , and I will pay thee all .
And he would not : but went and cast him into prison , till he should pay the debt .
So when his fellowservants saw what was done , they were very sorry , and came and told unto their lord all that was done .
Then his lord , after that he had called him , said unto him , O thou wicked servant , I forgave thee all that debt , because thou desiredst me :
Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant , even as I had pity on thee ?
And his lord was wroth , and delivered him to the tormentors , till he should pay all that was due unto him .
So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you , if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses .
And it came to pass , that when Jesus had finished these sayings , he departed from Galilee , and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan ;
And great multitudes followed him ; and he healed them there .
The Pharisees also came unto him , tempting him , and saying unto him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause ?
And he answered and said unto them , Have ye not read , that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female ,
And said , For this cause shall a man leave father and mother , and shall cleave to his wife : and they twain shall be one flesh ?
Wherefore they are no more twain , but one flesh . What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
They say unto him , Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement , and to put her away ?
He saith unto them , Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives : but from the beginning it was not so .
And I say unto you , Whosoever shall put away his wife , except it be for fornication , and shall marry another , committeth adultery : and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery .
His disciples say unto him , If the case of the man be so with his wife , it is not good to marry .
But he said unto them , All men cannot receive this saying , save they to whom it is given .
For there are some eunuchs , which were so born from their mother ' s womb : and there are some eunuchs , which were made eunuchs of men : and there be eunuchs , which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven ' s sake . He that is able to receive it , let him receive it .
Then were there brought unto him little children , that he should put his hands on them , and pray : and the disciples rebuked them .
But Jesus said , Suffer little children , and forbid them not , to come unto me : for of such is the kingdom of heaven .
And he laid his hands on them , and departed thence .
And , behold , one came and said unto him , Good Master , what good thing shall I do , that I may have eternal life ?
And he said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God : but if thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments .
He saith unto him , Which ? Jesus said , Thou shalt do no murder , Thou shalt not commit adultery , Thou shalt not steal , Thou shalt not bear false witness ,
Honour thy father and thy mother : and , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
The young man saith unto him , All these things have I kept from my youth up : what lack I yet ?
Jesus said unto him , If thou wilt be perfect , go and sell that thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come and follow me .
But when the young man heard that saying , he went away sorrowful : for he had great possessions .
Then said Jesus unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven .
And again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
When his disciples heard it , they were exceedingly amazed , saying , Who then can be saved ?
But Jesus beheld them , and said unto them , With men this is impossible ; but with God all things are possible .
Then answered Peter and said unto him , Behold , we have forsaken all , and followed thee ; what shall we have therefore ?
And Jesus said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That ye which have followed me , in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory , ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
And every one that hath forsaken houses , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my name ' s sake , shall receive an hundredfold , and shall inherit everlasting life .
But many that are first shall be last ; and the last shall be first .
For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder , which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard .
And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day , he sent them into his vineyard .
And he went out about the third hour , and saw others standing idle in the marketplace ,
And said unto them ; Go ye also into the vineyard , and whatsoever is right I will give you . And they went their way .
Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour , and did likewise .
And about the eleventh hour he went out , and found others standing idle , and saith unto them , Why stand ye here all the day idle ?
They say unto him , Because no man hath hired us . He saith unto them , Go ye also into the vineyard ; and whatsoever is right , that shall ye receive .
So when even was come , the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward , Call the labourers , and give them their hire , beginning from the last unto the first .
And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour , they received every man a penny .
But when the first came , they supposed that they should have received more ; and they likewise received every man a penny .
And when they had received it , they murmured against the goodman of the house ,
Saying , These last have wrought but one hour , and thou hast made them equal unto us , which have borne the burden and heat of the day .
But he answered one of them , and said , Friend , I do thee no wrong : didst not thou agree with me for a penny ?
Take that thine is , and go thy way : I will give unto this last , even as unto thee .
Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own ? Is thine eye evil , because I am good ?
So the last shall be first , and the first last : for many be called , but few chosen .
And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way , and said unto them ,
Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes , and they shall condemn him to death ,
And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock , and to scourge , and to crucify him : and the third day he shall rise again .
Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons , worshipping him , and desiring a certain thing of him .
And he said unto her , What wilt thou ? She saith unto him , Grant that these my two sons may sit , the one on thy right hand , and the other on the left , in thy kingdom .
But Jesus answered and said , Ye know not what ye ask . Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of , and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ? They say unto him , We are able .
And he saith unto them , Ye shall drink indeed of my cup , and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with : but to sit on my right hand , and on my left , is not mine to give , but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father .
And when the ten heard it , they were moved with indignation against the two brethren .
But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them , and they that are great exercise authority upon them .
But it shall not be so among you : but whosoever will be great among you , let him be your minister ;
And whosoever will be chief among you , let him be your servant :
Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
And as they departed from Jericho , a great multitude followed him .
And , behold , two blind men sitting by the way side , when they heard that Jesus passed by , cried out , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou son of David .
And the multitude rebuked them , because they should hold their peace : but they cried the more , saying , Have mercy on us , O Lord , thou son of David .
And Jesus stood still , and called them , and said , What will ye that I shall do unto you ?
They say unto him , Lord , that our eyes may be opened .
So Jesus had compassion on them , and touched their eyes : and immediately their eyes received sight , and they followed him .
And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem , and were come to Bethphage , unto the mount of Olives , then sent Jesus two disciples ,
Saying unto them , Go into the village over against you , and straightway ye shall find an ass tied , and a colt with her : loose them , and bring them unto me .
And if any man say ought unto you , ye shall say , The Lord hath need of them ; and straightway he will send them .
All this was done , that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , saying ,
Tell ye the daughter of Sion , Behold , thy King cometh unto thee , meek , and sitting upon an ass , and a colt the foal of an ass .
And the disciples went , and did as Jesus commanded them ,
And brought the ass , and the colt , and put on them their clothes , and they set him thereon .
And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way ; others cut down branches from the trees , and strawed them in the way .
And the multitudes that went before , and that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna to the son of David : Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord ; Hosanna in the highest .
And when he was come into Jerusalem , all the city was moved , saying , Who is this ?
And the multitude said , This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee .
And Jesus went into the temple of God , and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ,
And said unto them , It is written , My house shall be called the house of prayer ; but ye have made it a den of thieves .
And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple ; and he healed them .
And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did , and the children crying in the temple , and saying , Hosanna to the son of David ; they were sore displeased ,
And said unto him , Hearest thou what these say ? And Jesus saith unto them , Yea ; have ye never read , Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise ?
And he left them , and went out of the city into Bethany ; and he lodged there .
Now in the morning as he returned into the city , he hungered .
And when he saw a fig tree in the way , he came to it , and found nothing thereon , but leaves only , and said unto it , Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever . And presently the fig tree withered away .
And when the disciples saw it , they marvelled , saying , How soon is the fig tree withered away !
Jesus answered and said unto them , Verily I say unto you , If ye have faith , and doubt not , ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree , but also if ye shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; it shall be done .
And all things , whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer , believing , ye shall receive .
And when he was come into the temple , the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching , and said , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority ?
And Jesus answered and said unto them , I also will ask you one thing , which if ye tell me , I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things .
The baptism of John , whence was it ? from heaven , or of men ? And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say unto us , Why did ye not then believe him ?
But if we shall say , Of men ; we fear the people ; for all hold John as a prophet .
And they answered Jesus , and said , We cannot tell . And he said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
But what think ye ? A certain man had two sons ; and he came to the first , and said , Son , go work to day in my vineyard .
He answered and said , I will not : but afterward he repented , and went .
And he came to the second , and said likewise . And he answered and said , I go , sir : and went not .
Whether of them twain did the will of his father ? They say unto him , The first . Jesus saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you .
For John came unto you in the way of righteousness , and ye believed him not : but the publicans and the harlots believed him : and ye , when ye had seen it , repented not afterward , that ye might believe him .
Hear another parable : There was a certain householder , which planted a vineyard , and hedged it round about , and digged a winepress in it , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country :
And when the time of the fruit drew near , he sent his servants to the husbandmen , that they might receive the fruits of it .
And the husbandmen took his servants , and beat one , and killed another , and stoned another .
Again , he sent other servants more than the first : and they did unto them likewise .
But last of all he sent unto them his son , saying , They will reverence my son .
But when the husbandmen saw the son , they said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and let us seize on his inheritance .
And they caught him , and cast him out of the vineyard , and slew him .
When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh , what will he do unto those husbandmen ?
They say unto him , He will miserably destroy those wicked men , and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen , which shall render him the fruits in their seasons .
Jesus saith unto them , Did ye never read in the scriptures , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner : this is the Lord ' s doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
Therefore say I unto you , The kingdom of God shall be taken from you , and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof .
And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken : but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables , they perceived that he spake of them .
But when they sought to lay hands on him , they feared the multitude , because they took him for a prophet .
And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables , and said ,
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king , which made a marriage for his son ,
And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding : and they would not come .
Again , he sent forth other servants , saying , Tell them which are bidden , Behold , I have prepared my dinner : my oxen and my fatlings are killed , and all things are ready : come unto the marriage .
But they made light of it , and went their ways , one to his farm , another to his merchandise :
And the remnant took his servants , and entreated them spitefully , and slew them .
But when the king heard thereof , he was wroth : and he sent forth his armies , and destroyed those murderers , and burned up their city .
Then saith he to his servants , The wedding is ready , but they which were bidden were not worthy .
Go ye therefore into the highways , and as many as ye shall find , bid to the marriage .
So those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all as many as they found , both bad and good : and the wedding was furnished with guests .
And when the king came in to see the guests , he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment :
And he saith unto him , Friend , how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment ? And he was speechless .
Then said the king to the servants , Bind him hand and foot , and take him away , and cast him into outer darkness , there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
For many are called , but few are chosen .
Then went the Pharisees , and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk .
And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians , saying , Master , we know that thou art true , and teachest the way of God in truth , neither carest thou for any man : for thou regardest not the person of men .
Tell us therefore , What thinkest thou ? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar , or not ?
But Jesus perceived their wickedness , and said , Why tempt ye me , ye hypocrites ?
Shew me the tribute money . And they brought unto him a penny .
And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ?
They say unto him , Caesar ' s . Then saith he unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar ' s ; and unto God the things that are God ' s .
When they had heard these words , they marvelled , and left him , and went their way .
The same day came to him the Sadducees , which say that there is no resurrection , and asked him ,
Saying , Master , Moses said , If a man die , having no children , his brother shall marry his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
Now there were with us seven brethren : and the first , when he had married a wife , deceased , and , having no issue , left his wife unto his brother :
Likewise the second also , and the third , unto the seventh .
And last of all the woman died also .
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven ? for they all had her .
Jesus answered and said unto them , Ye do err , not knowing the scriptures , nor the power of God .
For in the resurrection they neither marry , nor are given in marriage , but are as the angels of God in heaven .
But as touching the resurrection of the dead , have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God , saying ,
I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ? God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
And when the multitude heard this , they were astonished at his doctrine .
But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence , they were gathered together .
Then one of them , which was a lawyer , asked him a question , tempting him , and saying ,
Master , which is the great commandment in the law ?
Jesus said unto him , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind .
This is the first and great commandment .
And the second is like unto it , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself .
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets .
While the Pharisees were gathered together , Jesus asked them ,
Saying , What think ye of Christ ? whose son is he ? They say unto him , The son of David .
He saith unto them , How then doth David in spirit call him Lord , saying ,
The LORD said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
If David then call him Lord , how is he his son ?
And no man was able to answer him a word , neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions .
Then spake Jesus to the multitude , and to his disciples ,
Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses ' seat :
All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe , that observe and do ; but do not ye after their works : for they say , and do not .
For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne , and lay them on men ' s shoulders ; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers .
But all their works they do for to be seen of men : they make broad their phylacteries , and enlarge the borders of their garments ,
And love the uppermost rooms at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues ,
And greetings in the markets , and to be called of men , Rabbi , Rabbi .
But be not ye called Rabbi : for one is your Master , even Christ ; and all ye are brethren .
And call no man your father upon the earth : for one is your Father , which is in heaven .
Neither be ye called masters : for one is your Master , even Christ .
But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant .
And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased ; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted .
But woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men : for ye neither go in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayer : therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte , and when he is made , ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves .
Woe unto you , ye blind guides , which say , Whosoever shall swear by the temple , it is nothing ; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple , he is a debtor !
Ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gold , or the temple that sanctifieth the gold ?
And , Whosoever shall swear by the altar , it is nothing ; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it , he is guilty .
Ye fools and blind : for whether is greater , the gift , or the altar that sanctifieth the gift ?
Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar , sweareth by it , and by all things thereon .
And whoso shall swear by the temple , sweareth by it , and by him that dwelleth therein .
And he that shall swear by heaven , sweareth by the throne of God , and by him that sitteth thereon .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin , and have omitted the weightier matters of the law , judgment , mercy , and faith : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
Ye blind guides , which strain at a gnat , and swallow a camel .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter , but within they are full of extortion and excess .
Thou blind Pharisee , cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter , that the outside of them may be clean also .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men ' s bones , and of all uncleanness .
Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! because ye build the tombs of the prophets , and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous ,
And say , If we had been in the days of our fathers , we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets .
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves , that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets .
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers .
Ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of hell ?
Wherefore , behold , I send unto you prophets , and wise men , and scribes : and some of them ye shall kill and crucify ; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues , and persecute them from city to city :
That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth , from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias , whom ye slew between the temple and the altar .
Verily I say unto you , All these things shall come upon this generation .
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , thou that killest the prophets , and stonest them which are sent unto thee , how often would I have gathered thy children together , even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings , and ye would not !
Behold , your house is left unto you desolate .
For I say unto you , Ye shall not see me henceforth , till ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
And Jesus went out , and departed from the temple : and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple .
And Jesus said unto them , See ye not all these things ? verily I say unto you , There shall not be left here one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives , the disciples came unto him privately , saying , Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign of thy coming , and of the end of the world ?
And Jesus answered and said unto them , Take heed that no man deceive you .
For many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and shall deceive many .
And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars : see that ye be not troubled : for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be famines , and pestilences , and earthquakes , in divers places .
All these are the beginning of sorrows .
Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted , and shall kill you : and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name ' s sake .
And then shall many be offended , and shall betray one another , and shall hate one another .
And many false prophets shall rise , and shall deceive many .
And because iniquity shall abound , the love of many shall wax cold .
But he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations ; and then shall the end come .
When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , stand in the holy place , ( whoso readeth , let him understand : )
Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains :
Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house :
Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes .
And woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter , neither on the sabbath day :
For then shall be great tribulation , such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time , no , nor ever shall be .
And except those days should be shortened , there should no flesh be saved : but for the elect ' s sake those days shall be shortened .
Then if any man shall say unto you , Lo , here is Christ , or there ; believe it not .
For there shall arise false Christs , and false prophets , and shall shew great signs and wonders ; insomuch that , if it were possible , they shall deceive the very elect .
Behold , I have told you before .
Wherefore if they shall say unto you , Behold , he is in the desert ; go not forth : behold , he is in the secret chambers ; believe it not .
For as the lightning cometh out of the east , and shineth even unto the west ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
For wheresoever the carcase is , there will the eagles be gathered together .
Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light , and the stars shall fall from heaven , and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken :
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven : and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn , and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory .
And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet , and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from one end of heaven to the other .
Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When his branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is nigh :
So likewise ye , when ye shall see all these things , know that it is near , even at the doors .
Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled .
Heaven and earth shall pass away , but my words shall not pass away .
But of that day and hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels of heaven , but my Father only .
But as the days of Noe were , so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking , marrying and giving in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark ,
And knew not until the flood came , and took them all away ; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be .
Then shall two be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
Two women shall be grinding at the mill ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
Watch therefore : for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come .
But know this , that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come , he would have watched , and would not have suffered his house to be broken up .
Therefore be ye also ready : for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh .
Who then is a faithful and wise servant , whom his lord hath made ruler over his household , to give them meat in due season ?
Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
Verily I say unto you , That he shall make him ruler over all his goods .
But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ;
And shall begin to smite his fellowservants , and to eat and drink with the drunken ;
The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him , and in an hour that he is not aware of ,
And shall cut him asunder , and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins , which took their lamps , and went forth to meet the bridegroom .
And five of them were wise , and five were foolish .
They that were foolish took their lamps , and took no oil with them :
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps .
While the bridegroom tarried , they all slumbered and slept .
And at midnight there was a cry made , Behold , the bridegroom cometh ; go ye out to meet him .
Then all those virgins arose , and trimmed their lamps .
And the foolish said unto the wise , Give us of your oil ; for our lamps are gone out .
But the wise answered , saying , Not so ; lest there be not enough for us and you : but go ye rather to them that sell , and buy for yourselves .
And while they went to buy , the bridegroom came ; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage : and the door was shut .
Afterward came also the other virgins , saying , Lord , Lord , open to us .
But he answered and said , Verily I say unto you , I know you not .
Watch therefore , for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh .
For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country , who called his own servants , and delivered unto them his goods .
And unto one he gave five talents , to another two , and to another one ; to every man according to his several ability ; and straightway took his journey .
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same , and made them other five talents .
And likewise he that had received two , he also gained other two .
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth , and hid his lord ' s money .
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh , and reckoneth with them .
And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents , saying , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me five talents : behold , I have gained beside them five talents more .
His lord said unto him , Well done , thou good and faithful servant : thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
He also that had received two talents came and said , Lord , thou deliveredst unto me two talents : behold , I have gained two other talents beside them .
His lord said unto him , Well done , good and faithful servant ; thou hast been faithful over a few things , I will make thee ruler over many things : enter thou into the joy of thy lord .
Then he which had received the one talent came and said , Lord , I knew thee that thou art an hard man , reaping where thou hast not sown , and gathering where thou hast not strawed :
And I was afraid , and went and hid thy talent in the earth : lo , there thou hast that is thine .
His lord answered and said unto him , Thou wicked and slothful servant , thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not , and gather where I have not strawed :
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers , and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury .
Take therefore the talent from him , and give it unto him which hath ten talents .
For unto every one that hath shall be given , and he shall have abundance : but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath .
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness : there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth .
When the Son of man shall come in his glory , and all the holy angels with him , then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory :
And before him shall be gathered all nations : and he shall separate them one from another , as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats :
And he shall set the sheep on his right hand , but the goats on the left .
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand , Come , ye blessed of my Father , inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :
For I was an hungred , and ye gave me meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me drink : I was a stranger , and ye took me in :
Naked , and ye clothed me : I was sick , and ye visited me : I was in prison , and ye came unto me .
Then shall the righteous answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , and fed thee ? or thirsty , and gave thee drink ?
When saw we thee a stranger , and took thee in ? or naked , and clothed thee ?
Or when saw we thee sick , or in prison , and came unto thee ?
And the King shall answer and say unto them , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren , ye have done it unto me .
Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand , Depart from me , ye cursed , into everlasting fire , prepared for the devil and his angels :
For I was an hungred , and ye gave me no meat : I was thirsty , and ye gave me no drink :
I was a stranger , and ye took me not in : naked , and ye clothed me not : sick , and in prison , and ye visited me not .
Then shall they also answer him , saying , Lord , when saw we thee an hungred , or athirst , or a stranger , or naked , or sick , or in prison , and did not minister unto thee ?
Then shall he answer them , saying , Verily I say unto you , Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me .
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment : but the righteous into life eternal .
And it came to pass , when Jesus had finished all these sayings , he said unto his disciples ,
Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover , and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified .
Then assembled together the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders of the people , unto the palace of the high priest , who was called Caiaphas ,
And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty , and kill him .
But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar among the people .
Now when Jesus was in Bethany , in the house of Simon the leper ,
There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment , and poured it on his head , as he sat at meat .
But when his disciples saw it , they had indignation , saying , To what purpose is this waste ?
For this ointment might have been sold for much , and given to the poor .
When Jesus understood it , he said unto them , Why trouble ye the woman ? for she hath wrought a good work upon me .
For ye have the poor always with you ; but me ye have not always .
For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body , she did it for my burial .
Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world , there shall also this , that this woman hath done , be told for a memorial of her .
Then one of the twelve , called Judas Iscariot , went unto the chief priests ,
And said unto them , What will ye give me , and I will deliver him unto you ? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver .
And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him .
Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus , saying unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover ?
And he said , Go into the city to such a man , and say unto him , The Master saith , My time is at hand ; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples .
And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them ; and they made ready the passover .
Now when the even was come , he sat down with the twelve .
And as they did eat , he said , Verily I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
And they were exceeding sorrowful , and began every one of them to say unto him , Lord , is it I ?
And he answered and said , He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish , the same shall betray me .
The Son of man goeth as it is written of him : but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! it had been good for that man if he had not been born .
Then Judas , which betrayed him , answered and said , Master , is it I ? He said unto him , Thou hast said .
And as they were eating , Jesus took bread , and blessed it , and brake it , and gave it to the disciples , and said , Take , eat ; this is my body .
And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and gave it to them , saying , Drink ye all of it ;
For this is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many for the remission of sins .
But I say unto you , I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine , until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father ' s kingdom .
And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives .
Then saith Jesus unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad .
But after I am risen again , I will go before you into Galilee .
Peter answered and said unto him , Though all men shall be offended because of thee , yet will I never be offended .
Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , That this night , before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
Peter said unto him , Though I should die with thee , yet will I not deny thee . Likewise also said all the disciples .
Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane , and saith unto the disciples , Sit ye here , while I go and pray yonder .
And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee , and began to be sorrowful and very heavy .
Then saith he unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful , even unto death : tarry ye here , and watch with me .
And he went a little farther , and fell on his face , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if it be possible , let this cup pass from me : nevertheless not as I will , but as thou wilt .
And he cometh unto the disciples , and findeth them asleep , and saith unto Peter , What , could ye not watch with me one hour ?
Watch and pray , that ye enter not into temptation : the spirit indeed is willing , but the flesh is weak .
He went away again the second time , and prayed , saying , O my Father , if this cup may not pass away from me , except I drink it , thy will be done .
And he came and found them asleep again : for their eyes were heavy .
And he left them , and went away again , and prayed the third time , saying the same words .
Then cometh he to his disciples , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : behold , the hour is at hand , and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
Rise , let us be going : behold , he is at hand that doth betray me .
And while he yet spake , lo , Judas , one of the twelve , came , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and elders of the people .
Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he : hold him fast .
And forthwith he came to Jesus , and said , Hail , master ; and kissed him .
And Jesus said unto him , Friend , wherefore art thou come ? Then came they , and laid hands on Jesus and took him .
And , behold , one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand , and drew his sword , and struck a servant of the high priest ' s , and smote off his ear .
Then said Jesus unto him , Put up again thy sword into his place : for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword .
Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father , and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels ?
But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled , that thus it must be ?
In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes , Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me ? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple , and ye laid no hold on me .
But all this was done , that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled . Then all the disciples forsook him , and fled .
And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest , where the scribes and the elders were assembled .
But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest ' s palace , and went in , and sat with the servants , to see the end .
Now the chief priests , and elders , and all the council , sought false witness against Jesus , to put him to death ;
But found none : yea , though many false witnesses came , yet found they none . At the last came two false witnesses ,
And said , This fellow said , I am able to destroy the temple of God , and to build it in three days .
And the high priest arose , and said unto him , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
But Jesus held his peace , And the high priest answered and said unto him , I adjure thee by the living God , that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ , the Son of God .
Jesus saith unto him , Thou hast said : nevertheless I say unto you , Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
Then the high priest rent his clothes , saying , He hath spoken blasphemy ; what further need have we of witnesses ? behold , now ye have heard his blasphemy .
What think ye ? They answered and said , He is guilty of death .
Then did they spit in his face , and buffeted him ; and others smote him with the palms of their hands ,
Saying , Prophesy unto us , thou Christ , Who is he that smote thee ?
Now Peter sat without in the palace : and a damsel came unto him , saying , Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee .
But he denied before them all , saying , I know not what thou sayest .
And when he was gone out into the porch , another maid saw him , and said unto them that were there , This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth .
And again he denied with an oath , I do not know the man .
And after a while came unto him they that stood by , and said to Peter , Surely thou also art one of them ; for thy speech bewrayeth thee .
Then began he to curse and to swear , saying , I know not the man . And immediately the cock crew .
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus , which said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice . And he went out , and wept bitterly .
When the morning was come , all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death :
And when they had bound him , they led him away , and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor .
Then Judas , which had betrayed him , when he saw that he was condemned , repented himself , and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders ,
Saying , I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood . And they said , What is that to us ? see thou to that .
And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple , and departed , and went and hanged himself .
And the chief priests took the silver pieces , and said , It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury , because it is the price of blood .
And they took counsel , and bought with them the potter ' s field , to bury strangers in .
Wherefore that field was called , The field of blood , unto this day .
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet , saying , And they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was valued , whom they of the children of Israel did value ;
And gave them for the potter ' s field , as the Lord appointed me .
And Jesus stood before the governor : and the governor asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And Jesus said unto him , Thou sayest .
And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders , he answered nothing .
Then said Pilate unto him , Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee ?
And he answered him to never a word ; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly .
Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner , whom they would .
And they had then a notable prisoner , called Barabbas .
Therefore when they were gathered together , Pilate said unto them , Whom will ye that I release unto you ? Barabbas , or Jesus which is called Christ ?
For he knew that for envy they had delivered him .
When he was set down on the judgment seat , his wife sent unto him , saying , Have thou nothing to do with that just man : for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him .
But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask Barabbas , and destroy Jesus .
The governor answered and said unto them , Whether of the twain will ye that I release unto you ? They said , Barabbas .
Pilate saith unto them , What shall I do then with Jesus which is called Christ ? They all say unto him , Let him be crucified .
And the governor said , Why , what evil hath he done ? But they cried out the more , saying , Let him be crucified .
When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing , but that rather a tumult was made , he took water , and washed his hands before the multitude , saying , I am innocent of the blood of this just person : see ye to it .
Then answered all the people , and said , His blood be on us , and on our children .
Then released he Barabbas unto them : and when he had scourged Jesus , he delivered him to be crucified .
Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall , and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers .
And they stripped him , and put on him a scarlet robe .
And when they had platted a crown of thorns , they put it upon his head , and a reed in his right hand : and they bowed the knee before him , and mocked him , saying , Hail , King of the Jews !
And they spit upon him , and took the reed , and smote him on the head .
And after that they had mocked him , they took the robe off from him , and put his own raiment on him , and led him away to crucify him .
And as they came out , they found a man of Cyrene , Simon by name : him they compelled to bear his cross .
And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha , that is to say , a place of a skull ,
They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall : and when he had tasted thereof , he would not drink .
And they crucified him , and parted his garments , casting lots : that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet , They parted my garments among them , and upon my vesture did they cast lots .
And sitting down they watched him there ;
And set up over his head his accusation written , THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
Then were there two thieves crucified with him , one on the right hand , and another on the left .
And they that passed by reviled him , wagging their heads ,
And saying , Thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days , save thyself . If thou be the Son of God , come down from the cross .
Likewise also the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes and elders , said ,
He saved others ; himself he cannot save . If he be the King of Israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will believe him .
He trusted in God ; let him deliver him now , if he will have him : for he said , I am the Son of God .
The thieves also , which were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth .
Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour .
And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eli , Eli , lama sabachthani ? that is to say , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
Some of them that stood there , when they heard that , said , This man calleth for Elias .
And straightway one of them ran , and took a spunge , and filled it with vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink .
The rest said , Let be , let us see whether Elias will come to save him .
Jesus , when he had cried again with a loud voice , yielded up the ghost .
And , behold , the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom ; and the earth did quake , and the rocks rent ;
And the graves were opened ; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose ,
And came out of the graves after his resurrection , and went into the holy city , and appeared unto many .
Now when the centurion , and they that were with him , watching Jesus , saw the earthquake , and those things that were done , they feared greatly , saying , Truly this was the Son of God .
And many women were there beholding afar off , which followed Jesus from Galilee , ministering unto him :
Among which was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James and Joses , and the mother of Zebedees children .
When the even was come , there came a rich man of Arimathaea , named Joseph , who also himself was Jesus ' disciple :
He went to Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus . Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered .
And when Joseph had taken the body , he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth ,
And laid it in his own new tomb , which he had hewn out in the rock : and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre , and departed .
And there was Mary Magdalene , and the other Mary , sitting over against the sepulchre .
Now the next day , that followed the day of the preparation , the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate ,
Saying , Sir , we remember that that deceiver said , while he was yet alive , After three days I will rise again .
Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day , lest his disciples come by night , and steal him away , and say unto the people , He is risen from the dead : so the last error shall be worse than the first .
Pilate said unto them , Ye have a watch : go your way , make it as sure as ye can .
So they went , and made the sepulchre sure , sealing the stone , and setting a watch .
The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ , the Son of God ;
As it is written in the prophets , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
John did baptize in the wilderness , and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins .
And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea , and they of Jerusalem , and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan , confessing their sins .
And John was clothed with camel ' s hair , and with a girdle of a skin about his loins ; and he did eat locusts and wild honey ;
And preached , saying , There cometh one mightier than I after me , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose .
I indeed have baptized you with water : but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost .
And it came to pass in those days , that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee , and was baptized of John in Jordan .
And straightway coming up out of the water , he saw the heavens opened , and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him :
And there came a voice from heaven , saying , Thou art my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness .
And he was there in the wilderness forty days , tempted of Satan ; and was with the wild beasts ; and the angels ministered unto him .
Now after that John was put in prison , Jesus came into Galilee , preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God ,
And saying , The time is fulfilled , and the kingdom of God is at hand : repent ye , and believe the gospel .
Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee , he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea : for they were fishers .
And Jesus said unto them , Come ye after me , and I will make you to become fishers of men .
And straightway they forsook their nets , and followed him .
And when he had gone a little farther thence , he saw James the son of Zebedee , and John his brother , who also were in the ship mending their nets .
And straightway he called them : and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants , and went after him .
And they went into Capernaum ; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue , and taught .
And they were astonished at his doctrine : for he taught them as one that had authority , and not as the scribes .
And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit ; and he cried out ,
Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him .
And when the unclean spirit had torn him , and cried with a loud voice , he came out of him .
And they were all amazed , insomuch that they questioned among themselves , saying , What thing is this ? what new doctrine is this ? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits , and they do obey him .
And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee .
And forthwith , when they were come out of the synagogue , they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew , with James and John .
But Simon ' s wife ' s mother lay sick of a fever , and anon they tell him of her .
And he came and took her by the hand , and lifted her up ; and immediately the fever left her , and she ministered unto them .
And at even , when the sun did set , they brought unto him all that were diseased , and them that were possessed with devils .
And all the city was gathered together at the door .
And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases , and cast out many devils ; and suffered not the devils to speak , because they knew him .
And in the morning , rising up a great while before day , he went out , and departed into a solitary place , and there prayed .
And Simon and they that were with him followed after him .
And when they had found him , they said unto him , All men seek for thee .
And he said unto them , Let us go into the next towns , that I may preach there also : for therefore came I forth .
And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee , and cast out devils .
And there came a leper to him , beseeching him , and kneeling down to him , and saying unto him , If thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
And Jesus , moved with compassion , put forth his hand , and touched him , and saith unto him , I will ; be thou clean .
And as soon as he had spoken , immediately the leprosy departed from him , and he was cleansed .
And he straitly charged him , and forthwith sent him away ;
And saith unto him , See thou say nothing to any man : but go thy way , shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
But he went out , and began to publish it much , and to blaze abroad the matter , insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city , but was without in desert places : and they came to him from every quarter .
And again he entered into Capernaum after some days ; and it was noised that he was in the house .
And straightway many were gathered together , insomuch that there was no room to receive them , no , not so much as about the door : and he preached the word unto them .
And they come unto him , bringing one sick of the palsy , which was borne of four .
And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press , they uncovered the roof where he was : and when they had broken it up , they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay .
When Jesus saw their faith , he said unto the sick of the palsy , Son , thy sins be forgiven thee .
But there was certain of the scribes sitting there , and reasoning in their hearts ,
Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies ? who can forgive sins but God only ?
And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves , he said unto them , Why reason ye these things in your hearts ?
Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Arise , and take up thy bed , and walk ?
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins , ( he saith to the sick of the palsy , )
I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy bed , and go thy way into thine house .
And immediately he arose , took up the bed , and went forth before them all ; insomuch that they were all amazed , and glorified God , saying , We never saw it on this fashion .
And he went forth again by the sea side ; and all the multitude resorted unto him , and he taught them .
And as he passed by , he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom , and said unto him , Follow me . And he arose and followed him .
And it came to pass , that , as Jesus sat at meat in his house , many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples : for there were many , and they followed him .
And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners , they said unto his disciples , How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners ?
When Jesus heard it , he saith unto them , They that are whole have no need of the physician , but they that are sick : I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast : and they come and say unto him , Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast , but thy disciples fast not ?
And Jesus said unto them , Can the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ? as long as they have the bridegroom with them , they cannot fast .
But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment : else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old , and the rent is made worse .
And no man putteth new wine into old bottles : else the new wine doth burst the bottles , and the wine is spilled , and the bottles will be marred : but new wine must be put into new bottles .
And it came to pass , that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day ; and his disciples began , as they went , to pluck the ears of corn .
And the Pharisees said unto him , Behold , why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful ?
And he said unto them , Have ye never read what David did , when he had need , and was an hungred , he , and they that were with him ?
How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest , and did eat the shewbread , which is not lawful to eat but for the priests , and gave also to them which were with him ?
And he said unto them , The sabbath was made for man , and not man for the sabbath :
Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath .
And he entered again into the synagogue ; and there was a man there which had a withered hand .
And they watched him , whether he would heal him on the sabbath day ; that they might accuse him .
And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand , Stand forth .
And he saith unto them , Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days , or to do evil ? to save life , or to kill ? But they held their peace .
And when he had looked round about on them with anger , being grieved for the hardness of their hearts , he saith unto the man , Stretch forth thine hand . And he stretched it out : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
And the Pharisees went forth , and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him , how they might destroy him .
But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea : and a great multitude from Galilee followed him , and from Judaea ,
And from Jerusalem , and from Idumaea , and from beyond Jordan ; and they about Tyre and Sidon , a great multitude , when they had heard what great things he did , came unto him .
And he spake to his disciples , that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude , lest they should throng him .
For he had healed many ; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him , as many as had plagues .
And unclean spirits , when they saw him , fell down before him , and cried , saying , Thou art the Son of God .
And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known .
And he goeth up into a mountain , and calleth unto him whom he would : and they came unto him .
And he ordained twelve , that they should be with him , and that he might send them forth to preach ,
And to have power to heal sicknesses , and to cast out devils :
And Simon he surnamed Peter ;
And James the son of Zebedee , and John the brother of James ; and he surnamed them Boanerges , which is , The sons of thunder :
And Andrew , and Philip , and Bartholomew , and Matthew , and Thomas , and James the son of Alphaeus , and Thaddaeus , and Simon the Canaanite ,
And Judas Iscariot , which also betrayed him : and they went into an house .
And the multitude cometh together again , so that they could not so much as eat bread .
And when his friends heard of it , they went out to lay hold on him : for they said , He is beside himself .
And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said , He hath Beelzebub , and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils .
And he called them unto him , and said unto them in parables , How can Satan cast out Satan ?
And if a kingdom be divided against itself , that kingdom cannot stand .
And if a house be divided against itself , that house cannot stand .
And if Satan rise up against himself , and be divided , he cannot stand , but hath an end .
No man can enter into a strong man ' s house , and spoil his goods , except he will first bind the strong man ; and then he will spoil his house .
Verily I say unto you , All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men , and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme :
But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness , but is in danger of eternal damnation .
Because they said , He hath an unclean spirit .
There came then his brethren and his mother , and , standing without , sent unto him , calling him .
And the multitude sat about him , and they said unto him , Behold , thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee .
And he answered them , saying , Who is my mother , or my brethren ?
And he looked round about on them which sat about him , and said , Behold my mother and my brethren !
For whosoever shall do the will of God , the same is my brother , and my sister , and mother .
And he began again to teach by the sea side : and there was gathered unto him a great multitude , so that he entered into a ship , and sat in the sea ; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land .
And he taught them many things by parables , and said unto them in his doctrine ,
Hearken ; Behold , there went out a sower to sow :
And it came to pass , as he sowed , some fell by the way side , and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up .
And some fell on stony ground , where it had not much earth ; and immediately it sprang up , because it had no depth of earth :
But when the sun was up , it was scorched ; and because it had no root , it withered away .
And some fell among thorns , and the thorns grew up , and choked it , and it yielded no fruit .
And other fell on good ground , and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased ; and brought forth , some thirty , and some sixty , and some an hundred .
And he said unto them , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
And when he was alone , they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable .
And he said unto them , Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God : but unto them that are without , all these things are done in parables :
That seeing they may see , and not perceive ; and hearing they may hear , and not understand ; lest at any time they should be converted , and their sins should be forgiven them .
And he said unto them , Know ye not this parable ? and how then will ye know all parables ?
The sower soweth the word .
And these are they by the way side , where the word is sown ; but when they have heard , Satan cometh immediately , and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts .
And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground ; who , when they have heard the word , immediately receive it with gladness ;
And have no root in themselves , and so endure but for a time : afterward , when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word ' s sake , immediately they are offended .
And these are they which are sown among thorns ; such as hear the word ,
And the cares of this world , and the deceitfulness of riches , and the lusts of other things entering in , choke the word , and it becometh unfruitful .
And these are they which are sown on good ground ; such as hear the word , and receive it , and bring forth fruit , some thirtyfold , some sixty , and some an hundred .
And he said unto them , Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel , or under a bed ? and not to be set on a candlestick ?
For there is nothing hid , which shall not be manifested ; neither was any thing kept secret , but that it should come abroad .
If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
And he said unto them , Take heed what ye hear : with what measure ye mete , it shall be measured to you : and unto you that hear shall more be given .
For he that hath , to him shall be given : and he that hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he hath .
And he said , So is the kingdom of God , as if a man should cast seed into the ground ;
And should sleep , and rise night and day , and the seed should spring and grow up , he knoweth not how .
For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself ; first the blade , then the ear , after that the full corn in the ear .
But when the fruit is brought forth , immediately he putteth in the sickle , because the harvest is come .
And he said , Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God ? or with what comparison shall we compare it ?
It is like a grain of mustard seed , which , when it is sown in the earth , is less than all the seeds that be in the earth :
But when it is sown , it groweth up , and becometh greater than all herbs , and shooteth out great branches ; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it .
And with many such parables spake he the word unto them , as they were able to hear it .
But without a parable spake he not unto them : and when they were alone , he expounded all things to his disciples .
And the same day , when the even was come , he saith unto them , Let us pass over unto the other side .
And when they had sent away the multitude , they took him even as he was in the ship . And there were also with him other little ships .
And there arose a great storm of wind , and the waves beat into the ship , so that it was now full .
And he was in the hinder part of the ship , asleep on a pillow : and they awake him , and say unto him , Master , carest thou not that we perish ?
And he arose , and rebuked the wind , and said unto the sea , Peace , be still . And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm .
And he said unto them , Why are ye so fearful ? how is it that ye have no faith ?
And they feared exceedingly , and said one to another , What manner of man is this , that even the wind and the sea obey him ?
And they came over unto the other side of the sea , into the country of the Gadarenes .
And when he was come out of the ship , immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit ,
Who had his dwelling among the tombs ; and no man could bind him , no , not with chains :
Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains , and the chains had been plucked asunder by him , and the fetters broken in pieces : neither could any man tame him .
And always , night and day , he was in the mountains , and in the tombs , crying , and cutting himself with stones .
But when he saw Jesus afar off , he ran and worshipped him ,
And cried with a loud voice , and said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of the most high God ? I adjure thee by God , that thou torment me not .
For he said unto him , Come out of the man , thou unclean spirit .
And he asked him , What is thy name ? And he answered , saying , My name is Legion : for we are many .
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country .
Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding .
And all the devils besought him , saying , Send us into the swine , that we may enter into them .
And forthwith Jesus gave them leave . And the unclean spirits went out , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea , ( they were about two thousand ; ) and were choked in the sea .
And they that fed the swine fled , and told it in the city , and in the country . And they went out to see what it was that was done .
And they come to Jesus , and see him that was possessed with the devil , and had the legion , sitting , and clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil , and also concerning the swine .
And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts .
And when he was come into the ship , he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him .
Howbeit Jesus suffered him not , but saith unto him , Go home to thy friends , and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee , and hath had compassion on thee .
And he departed , and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him : and all men did marvel .
And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side , much people gathered unto him : and he was nigh unto the sea .
And , behold , there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue , Jairus by name ; and when he saw him , he fell at his feet ,
And besought him greatly , saying , My little daughter lieth at the point of death : I pray thee , come and lay thy hands on her , that she may be healed ; and she shall live .
And Jesus went with him ; and much people followed him , and thronged him .
And a certain woman , which had an issue of blood twelve years ,
And had suffered many things of many physicians , and had spent all that she had , and was nothing bettered , but rather grew worse ,
When she had heard of Jesus , came in the press behind , and touched his garment .
For she said , If I may touch but his clothes , I shall be whole .
And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up ; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague .
And Jesus , immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him , turned him about in the press , and said , Who touched my clothes ?
And his disciples said unto him , Thou seest the multitude thronging thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing .
But the woman fearing and trembling , knowing what was done in her , came and fell down before him , and told him all the truth .
And he said unto her , Daughter , thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace , and be whole of thy plague .
While he yet spake , there came from the ruler of the synagogue ' s house certain which said , Thy daughter is dead : why troublest thou the Master any further ?
As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken , he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue , Be not afraid , only believe .
And he suffered no man to follow him , save Peter , and James , and John the brother of James .
And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue , and seeth the tumult , and them that wept and wailed greatly .
And when he was come in , he saith unto them , Why make ye this ado , and weep ? the damsel is not dead , but sleepeth .
And they laughed him to scorn . But when he had put them all out , he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel , and them that were with him , and entereth in where the damsel was lying .
And he took the damsel by the hand , and said unto her , Talitha cumi ; which is , being interpreted , Damsel , I say unto thee , arise .
And straightway the damsel arose , and walked ; for she was of the age of twelve years . And they were astonished with a great astonishment .
And he charged them straitly that no man should know it ; and commanded that something should be given her to eat .
And he went out from thence , and came into his own country ; and his disciples follow him .
And when the sabbath day was come , he began to teach in the synagogue : and many hearing him were astonished , saying , From whence hath this man these things ? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him , that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands ?
Is not this the carpenter , the son of Mary , the brother of James , and Joses , and of Juda , and Simon ? and are not his sisters here with us ? And they were offended at him .
But Jesus , said unto them , A prophet is not without honour , but in his own country , and among his own kin , and in his own house .
And he could there do no mighty work , save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk , and healed them .
And he marvelled because of their unbelief . And he went round about the villages , teaching .
And he called unto him the twelve , and began to send them forth by two and two ; and gave them power over unclean spirits ;
And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey , save a staff only ; no scrip , no bread , no money in their purse :
But be shod with sandals ; and not put on two coats .
And he said unto them , In what place soever ye enter into an house , there abide till ye depart from that place .
And whosoever shall not receive you , nor hear you , when ye depart thence , shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them . Verily I say unto you , It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment , than for that city .
And they went out , and preached that men should repent .
And they cast out many devils , and anointed with oil many that were sick , and healed them .
And king Herod heard of him ; ( for his name was spread abroad : ) and he said , That John the Baptist was risen from the dead , and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him .
Others said , That it is Elias . And others said , That it is a prophet , or as one of the prophets .
But when Herod heard thereof , he said , It is John , whom I beheaded : he is risen from the dead .
For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John , and bound him in prison for Herodias ' sake , his brother Philip ' s wife : for he had married her .
For John had said unto Herod , It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother ' s wife .
Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him , and would have killed him ; but she could not :
For Herod feared John , knowing that he was a just man and an holy , and observed him ; and when he heard him , he did many things , and heard him gladly .
And when a convenient day was come , that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords , high captains , and chief estates of Galilee ;
And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in , and danced , and pleased Herod and them that sat with him , the king said unto the damsel , Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt , and I will give it thee .
And he sware unto her , Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me , I will give it thee , unto the half of my kingdom .
And she went forth , and said unto her mother , What shall I ask ? And she said , The head of John the Baptist .
And she came in straightway with haste unto the king , and asked , saying , I will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of John the Baptist .
And the king was exceeding sorry ; yet for his oath ' s sake , and for their sakes which sat with him , he would not reject her .
And immediately the king sent an executioner , and commanded his head to be brought : and he went and beheaded him in the prison ,
And brought his head in a charger , and gave it to the damsel : and the damsel gave it to her mother .
And when his disciples heard of it , they came and took up his corpse , and laid it in a tomb .
And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus , and told him all things , both what they had done , and what they had taught .
And he said unto them , Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place , and rest a while : for there were many coming and going , and they had no leisure so much as to eat .
And they departed into a desert place by ship privately .
And the people saw them departing , and many knew him , and ran afoot thither out of all cities , and outwent them , and came together unto him .
And Jesus , when he came out , saw much people , and was moved with compassion toward them , because they were as sheep not having a shepherd : and he began to teach them many things .
And when the day was now far spent , his disciples came unto him , and said , This is a desert place , and now the time is far passed :
Send them away , that they may go into the country round about , and into the villages , and buy themselves bread : for they have nothing to eat .
He answered and said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they say unto him , Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread , and give them to eat ?
He saith unto them , How many loaves have ye ? go and see . And when they knew , they say , Five , and two fishes .
And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass .
And they sat down in ranks , by hundreds , and by fifties .
And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes , he looked up to heaven , and blessed , and brake the loaves , and gave them to his disciples to set before them ; and the two fishes divided he among them all .
And they did all eat , and were filled .
And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments , and of the fishes .
And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men .
And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship , and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida , while he sent away the people .
And when he had sent them away , he departed into a mountain to pray .
And when even was come , the ship was in the midst of the sea , and he alone on the land .
And he saw them toiling in rowing ; for the wind was contrary unto them : and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them , walking upon the sea , and would have passed by them .
But when they saw him walking upon the sea , they supposed it had been a spirit , and cried out :
For they all saw him , and were troubled . And immediately he talked with them , and saith unto them , Be of good cheer : it is I ; be not afraid .
And he went up unto them into the ship ; and the wind ceased : and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure , and wondered .
For they considered not the miracle of the loaves : for their heart was hardened .
And when they had passed over , they came into the land of Gennesaret , and drew to the shore .
And when they were come out of the ship , straightway they knew him ,
And ran through that whole region round about , and began to carry about in beds those that were sick , where they heard he was .
And whithersoever he entered , into villages , or cities , or country , they laid the sick in the streets , and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment : and as many as touched him were made whole .
Then came together unto him the Pharisees , and certain of the scribes , which came from Jerusalem .
And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled , that is to say , with unwashen , hands , they found fault .
For the Pharisees , and all the Jews , except they wash their hands oft , eat not , holding the tradition of the elders .
And when they come from the market , except they wash , they eat not . And many other things there be , which they have received to hold , as the washing of cups , and pots , brasen vessels , and of tables .
Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him , Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders , but eat bread with unwashen hands ?
He answered and said unto them , Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites , as it is written , This people honoureth me with their lips , but their heart is far from me .
Howbeit in vain do they worship me , teaching for doctrines the commandments of men .
For laying aside the commandment of God , ye hold the tradition of men , as the washing of pots and cups : and many other such like things ye do .
And he said unto them , Full well ye reject the commandment of God , that ye may keep your own tradition .
For Moses said , Honour thy father and thy mother ; and , Whoso curseth father or mother , let him die the death :
But ye say , If a man shall say to his father or mother , It is Corban , that is to say , a gift , by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me ; he shall be free .
And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother ;
Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition , which ye have delivered : and many such like things do ye .
And when he had called all the people unto him , he said unto them , Hearken unto me every one of you , and understand :
There is nothing from without a man , that entering into him can defile him : but the things which come out of him , those are they that defile the man .
If any man have ears to hear , let him hear .
And when he was entered into the house from the people , his disciples asked him concerning the parable .
And he saith unto them , Are ye so without understanding also ? Do ye not perceive , that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man , it cannot defile him ;
Because it entereth not into his heart , but into the belly , and goeth out into the draught , purging all meats ?
And he said , That which cometh out of the man , that defileth the man .
For from within , out of the heart of men , proceed evil thoughts , adulteries , fornications , murders ,
Thefts , covetousness , wickedness , deceit , lasciviousness , an evil eye , blasphemy , pride , foolishness :
All these evil things come from within , and defile the man .
And from thence he arose , and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon , and entered into an house , and would have no man know it : but he could not be hid .
For a certain woman , whose young daughter had an unclean spirit , heard of him , and came and fell at his feet :
The woman was a Greek , a Syrophenician by nation ; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter .
But Jesus said unto her , Let the children first be filled : for it is not meet to take the children ' s bread , and to cast it unto the dogs .
And she answered and said unto him , Yes , Lord : yet the dogs under the table eat of the children ' s crumbs .
And he said unto her , For this saying go thy way ; the devil is gone out of thy daughter .
And when she was come to her house , she found the devil gone out , and her daughter laid upon the bed .
And again , departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon , he came unto the sea of Galilee , through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis .
And they bring unto him one that was deaf , and had an impediment in his speech ; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him .
And he took him aside from the multitude , and put his fingers into his ears , and he spit , and touched his tongue ;
And looking up to heaven , he sighed , and saith unto him , Ephphatha , that is , Be opened .
And straightway his ears were opened , and the string of his tongue was loosed , and he spake plain .
And he charged them that they should tell no man : but the more he charged them , so much the more a great deal they published it ;
And were beyond measure astonished , saying , He hath done all things well : he maketh both the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak .
In those days the multitude being very great , and having nothing to eat , Jesus called his disciples unto him , and saith unto them ,
I have compassion on the multitude , because they have now been with me three days , and have nothing to eat :
And if I send them away fasting to their own houses , they will faint by the way : for divers of them came from far .
And his disciples answered him , From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness ?
And he asked them , How many loaves have ye ? And they said , Seven .
And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground : and he took the seven loaves , and gave thanks , and brake , and gave to his disciples to set before them ; and they did set them before the people .
And they had a few small fishes : and he blessed , and commanded to set them also before them .
So they did eat , and were filled : and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets .
And they that had eaten were about four thousand : and he sent them away .
And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples , and came into the parts of Dalmanutha .
And the Pharisees came forth , and began to question with him , seeking of him a sign from heaven , tempting him .
And he sighed deeply in his spirit , and saith , Why doth this generation seek after a sign ? verily I say unto you , There shall no sign be given unto this generation .
And he left them , and entering into the ship again departed to the other side .
Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread , neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf .
And he charged them , saying , Take heed , beware of the leaven of the Pharisees , and of the leaven of Herod .
And they reasoned among themselves , saying , It is because we have no bread .
And when Jesus knew it , he saith unto them , Why reason ye , because ye have no bread ? perceive ye not yet , neither understand ? have ye your heart yet hardened ?
Having eyes , see ye not ? and having ears , hear ye not ? and do ye not remember ?
When I brake the five loaves among five thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? They say unto him , Twelve .
And when the seven among four thousand , how many baskets full of fragments took ye up ? And they said , Seven .
And he said unto them , How is it that ye do not understand ?
And he cometh to Bethsaida ; and they bring a blind man unto him , and besought him to touch him .
And he took the blind man by the hand , and led him out of the town ; and when he had spit on his eyes , and put his hands upon him , he asked him if he saw ought .
And he looked up , and said , I see men as trees , walking .
After that he put his hands again upon his eyes , and made him look up : and he was restored , and saw every man clearly .
And he sent him away to his house , saying , Neither go into the town , nor tell it to any in the town .
And Jesus went out , and his disciples , into the towns of Caesarea Philippi : and by the way he asked his disciples , saying unto them , Whom do men say that I am ?
And they answered , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elias ; and others , One of the prophets .
And he saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? And Peter answereth and saith unto him , Thou art the Christ .
And he charged them that they should tell no man of him .
And he began to teach them , that the Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders , and of the chief priests , and scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again .
And he spake that saying openly . And Peter took him , and began to rebuke him .
But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples , he rebuked Peter , saying , Get thee behind me , Satan : for thou savourest not the things that be of God , but the things that be of men .
And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also , he said unto them , Whosoever will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross , and follow me .
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it ; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel ' s , the same shall save it .
For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ?
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ?
Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation ; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels .
And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , That there be some of them that stand here , which shall not taste of death , till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power .
And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter , and James , and John , and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves : and he was transfigured before them .
And his raiment became shining , exceeding white as snow ; so as no fuller on earth can white them .
And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses : and they were talking with Jesus .
And Peter answered and said to Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias .
For he wist not what to say ; for they were sore afraid .
And there was a cloud that overshadowed them : and a voice came out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
And suddenly , when they had looked round about , they saw no man any more , save Jesus only with themselves .
And as they came down from the mountain , he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen , till the Son of man were risen from the dead .
And they kept that saying with themselves , questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean .
And they asked him , saying , Why say the scribes that Elias must first come ?
And he answered and told them , Elias verily cometh first , and restoreth all things ; and how it is written of the Son of man , that he must suffer many things , and be set at nought .
But I say unto you , That Elias is indeed come , and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed , as it is written of him .
And when he came to his disciples , he saw a great multitude about them , and the scribes questioning with them .
And straightway all the people , when they beheld him , were greatly amazed , and running to him saluted him .
And he asked the scribes , What question ye with them ?
And one of the multitude answered and said , Master , I have brought unto thee my son , which hath a dumb spirit ;
And wheresoever he taketh him , he teareth him : and he foameth , and gnasheth with his teeth , and pineth away : and I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out ; and they could not .
He answereth him , and saith , O faithless generation , how long shall I be with you ? how long shall I suffer you ? bring him unto me .
And they brought him unto him : and when he saw him , straightway the spirit tare him ; and he fell on the ground , and wallowed foaming .
And he asked his father , How long is it ago since this came unto him ? And he said , Of a child .
And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire , and into the waters , to destroy him : but if thou canst do any thing , have compassion on us , and help us .
Jesus said unto him , If thou canst believe , all things are possible to him that believeth .
And straightway the father of the child cried out , and said with tears , Lord , I believe ; help thou mine unbelief .
When Jesus saw that the people came running together , he rebuked the foul spirit , saying unto him , Thou dumb and deaf spirit , I charge thee , come out of him , and enter no more into him .
And the spirit cried , and rent him sore , and came out of him : and he was as one dead ; insomuch that many said , He is dead .
But Jesus took him by the hand , and lifted him up ; and he arose .
And when he was come into the house , his disciples asked him privately , Why could not we cast him out ?
And he said unto them , This kind can come forth by nothing , but by prayer and fasting .
And they departed thence , and passed through Galilee ; and he would not that any man should know it .
For he taught his disciples , and said unto them , The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men , and they shall kill him ; and after that he is killed , he shall rise the third day .
But they understood not that saying , and were afraid to ask him .
And he came to Capernaum : and being in the house he asked them , What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way ?
But they held their peace : for by the way they had disputed among themselves , who should be the greatest .
And he sat down , and called the twelve , and saith unto them , If any man desire to be first , the same shall be last of all , and servant of all .
And he took a child , and set him in the midst of them : and when he had taken him in his arms , he said unto them ,
Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name , receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me , receiveth not me , but him that sent me .
And John answered him , saying , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name , and he followeth not us : and we forbad him , because he followeth not us .
But Jesus said , Forbid him not : for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name , that can lightly speak evil of me .
For he that is not against us is on our part .
For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name , because ye belong to Christ , verily I say unto you , he shall not lose his reward .
And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me , it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he were cast into the sea .
And if thy hand offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter into life maimed , than having two hands to go into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
And if thy foot offend thee , cut it off : it is better for thee to enter halt into life , than having two feet to be cast into hell , into the fire that never shall be quenched :
Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
And if thine eye offend thee , pluck it out : it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye , than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire :
Where their worm dieth not , and the fire is not quenched .
For every one shall be salted with fire , and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt .
Salt is good : but if the salt have lost his saltness , wherewith will ye season it ? Have salt in yourselves , and have peace one with another .
And he arose from thence , and cometh into the coasts of Judaea by the farther side of Jordan : and the people resort unto him again ; and , as he was wont , he taught them again .
And the Pharisees came to him , and asked him , Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife ? tempting him .
And he answered and said unto them , What did Moses command you ?
And they said , Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement , and to put her away .
And Jesus answered and said unto them , For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept .
But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female .
For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ;
And they twain shall be one flesh : so then they are no more twain , but one flesh .
What therefore God hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter .
And he saith unto them , Whosoever shall put away his wife , and marry another , committeth adultery against her .
And if a woman shall put away her husband , and be married to another , she committeth adultery .
And they brought young children to him , that he should touch them : and his disciples rebuked those that brought them .
But when Jesus saw it , he was much displeased , and said unto them , Suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child , he shall not enter therein .
And he took them up in his arms , put his hands upon them , and blessed them .
And when he was gone forth into the way , there came one running , and kneeled to him , and asked him , Good Master , what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life ?
And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? there is none good but one , that is , God .
Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Defraud not , Honour thy father and mother .
And he answered and said unto him , Master , all these have I observed from my youth .
Then Jesus beholding him loved him , and said unto him , One thing thou lackest : go thy way , sell whatsoever thou hast , and give to the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , take up the cross , and follow me .
And he was sad at that saying , and went away grieved : for he had great possessions .
And Jesus looked round about , and saith unto his disciples , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
And the disciples were astonished at his words . But Jesus answereth again , and saith unto them , Children , how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God !
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
And they were astonished out of measure , saying among themselves , Who then can be saved ?
And Jesus looking upon them saith , With men it is impossible , but not with God : for with God all things are possible .
Then Peter began to say unto him , Lo , we have left all , and have followed thee .
And Jesus answered and said , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or brethren , or sisters , or father , or mother , or wife , or children , or lands , for my sake , and the gospel ' s ,
But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time , houses , and brethren , and sisters , and mothers , and children , and lands , with persecutions ; and in the world to come eternal life .
But many that are first shall be last ; and the last first .
And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem ; and Jesus went before them : and they were amazed ; and as they followed , they were afraid . And he took again the twelve , and began to tell them what things should happen unto him ,
Saying , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem ; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests , and unto the scribes ; and they shall condemn him to death , and shall deliver him to the Gentiles :
And they shall mock him , and shall scourge him , and shall spit upon him , and shall kill him : and the third day he shall rise again .
And James and John , the sons of Zebedee , come unto him , saying , Master , we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire .
And he said unto them , What would ye that I should do for you ?
They said unto him , Grant unto us that we may sit , one on thy right hand , and the other on thy left hand , in thy glory .
But Jesus said unto them , Ye know not what ye ask : can ye drink of the cup that I drink of ? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with ?
And they said unto him , We can . And Jesus said unto them , Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of ; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized :
But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give ; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared .
And when the ten heard it , they began to be much displeased with James and John .
But Jesus called them to him , and saith unto them , Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and their great ones exercise authority upon them .
But so shall it not be among you : but whosoever will be great among you , shall be your minister :
And whosoever of you will be the chiefest , shall be servant of all .
For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , and to give his life a ransom for many .
And they came to Jericho : and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people , blind Bartimaeus , the son of Timaeus , sat by the highway side begging .
And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth , he began to cry out , and say , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me .
And many charged him that he should hold his peace : but he cried the more a great deal , Thou son of David , have mercy on me .
And Jesus stood still , and commanded him to be called . And they call the blind man , saying unto him , Be of good comfort , rise ; he calleth thee .
And he , casting away his garment , rose , and came to Jesus .
And Jesus answered and said unto him , What wilt thou that I should do unto thee ? The blind man said unto him , Lord , that I might receive my sight .
And Jesus said unto him , Go thy way ; thy faith hath made thee whole . And immediately he received his sight , and followed Jesus in the way .
And when they came nigh to Jerusalem , unto Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount of Olives , he sendeth forth two of his disciples ,
And saith unto them , Go your way into the village over against you : and as soon as ye be entered into it , ye shall find a colt tied , whereon never man sat ; loose him , and bring him .
And if any man say unto you , Why do ye this ? say ye that the Lord hath need of him ; and straightway he will send him hither .
And they went their way , and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met ; and they loose him .
And certain of them that stood there said unto them , What do ye , loosing the colt ?
And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded : and they let them go .
And they brought the colt to Jesus , and cast their garments on him ; and he sat upon him .
And many spread their garments in the way : and others cut down branches off the trees , and strawed them in the way .
And they that went before , and they that followed , cried , saying , Hosanna ; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord :
Blessed be the kingdom of our father David , that cometh in the name of the Lord : Hosanna in the highest .
And Jesus entered into Jerusalem , and into the temple : and when he had looked round about upon all things , and now the eventide was come , he went out unto Bethany with the twelve .
And on the morrow , when they were come from Bethany , he was hungry :
And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves , he came , if haply he might find any thing thereon : and when he came to it , he found nothing but leaves ; for the time of figs was not yet .
And Jesus answered and said unto it , No man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever . And his disciples heard it .
And they come to Jerusalem : and Jesus went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple , and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers , and the seats of them that sold doves ;
And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple .
And he taught , saying unto them , Is it not written , My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer ? but ye have made it a den of thieves .
And the scribes and chief priests heard it , and sought how they might destroy him : for they feared him , because all the people was astonished at his doctrine .
And when even was come , he went out of the city .
And in the morning , as they passed by , they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots .
And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him , Master , behold , the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away .
And Jesus answering saith unto them , Have faith in God .
For verily I say unto you , That whosoever shall say unto this mountain , Be thou removed , and be thou cast into the sea ; and shall not doubt in his heart , but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass ; he shall have whatsoever he saith .
Therefore I say unto you , What things soever ye desire , when ye pray , believe that ye receive them , and ye shall have them .
And when ye stand praying , forgive , if ye have ought against any : that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses .
But if ye do not forgive , neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses .
And they come again to Jerusalem : and as he was walking in the temple , there come to him the chief priests , and the scribes , and the elders ,
And say unto him , By what authority doest thou these things ? and who gave thee this authority to do these things ?
And Jesus answered and said unto them , I will also ask of you one question , and answer me , and I will tell you by what authority I do these things .
The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ? answer me .
And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then did ye not believe him ?
But if we shall say , Of men ; they feared the people : for all men counted John , that he was a prophet indeed .
And they answered and said unto Jesus , We cannot tell . And Jesus answering saith unto them , Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things .
And he began to speak unto them by parables . A certain man planted a vineyard , and set an hedge about it , and digged a place for the winefat , and built a tower , and let it out to husbandmen , and went into a far country .
And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant , that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard .
And they caught him , and beat him , and sent him away empty .
And again he sent unto them another servant ; and at him they cast stones , and wounded him in the head , and sent him away shamefully handled .
And again he sent another ; and him they killed , and many others ; beating some , and killing some .
Having yet therefore one son , his wellbeloved , he sent him also last unto them , saying , They will reverence my son .
But those husbandmen said among themselves , This is the heir ; come , let us kill him , and the inheritance shall be our ' s .
And they took him , and killed him , and cast him out of the vineyard .
What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do ? he will come and destroy the husbandmen , and will give the vineyard unto others .
And have ye not read this scripture ; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner :
This was the Lord ' s doing , and it is marvellous in our eyes ?
And they sought to lay hold on him , but feared the people : for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them : and they left him , and went their way .
And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians , to catch him in his words .
And when they were come , they say unto him , Master , we know that thou art true , and carest for no man : for thou regardest not the person of men , but teachest the way of God in truth : Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar , or not ?
Shall we give , or shall we not give ? But he , knowing their hypocrisy , said unto them , Why tempt ye me ? bring me a penny , that I may see it .
And they brought it . And he saith unto them , Whose is this image and superscription ? And they said unto him , Caesar ' s .
And Jesus answering said unto them , Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar ' s , and to God the things that are God ' s . And they marvelled at him .
Then come unto him the Sadducees , which say there is no resurrection ; and they asked him , saying ,
Master , Moses wrote unto us , If a man ' s brother die , and leave his wife behind him , and leave no children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
Now there were seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and dying left no seed .
And the second took her , and died , neither left he any seed : and the third likewise .
And the seven had her , and left no seed : last of all the woman died also .
In the resurrection therefore , when they shall rise , whose wife shall she be of them ? for the seven had her to wife .
And Jesus answering said unto them , Do ye not therefore err , because ye know not the scriptures , neither the power of God ?
For when they shall rise from the dead , they neither marry , nor are given in marriage ; but are as the angels which are in heaven .
And as touching the dead , that they rise : have ye not read in the book of Moses , how in the bush God spake unto him , saying , I am the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob ?
He is not the God of the dead , but the God of the living : ye therefore do greatly err .
And one of the scribes came , and having heard them reasoning together , and perceiving that he had answered them well , asked him , Which is the first commandment of all ?
And Jesus answered him , The first of all the commandments is , Hear , O Israel ; The Lord our God is one Lord :
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy mind , and with all thy strength : this is the first commandment .
And the second is like , namely this , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself . There is none other commandment greater than these .
And the scribe said unto him , Well , Master , thou hast said the truth : for there is one God ; and there is none other but he :
And to love him with all the heart , and with all the understanding , and with all the soul , and with all the strength , and to love his neighbour as himself , is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices .
And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly , he said unto him , Thou art not far from the kingdom of God . And no man after that durst ask him any question .
And Jesus answered and said , while he taught in the temple , How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David ?
For David himself said by the Holy Ghost , The LORD said to my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand , till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
David therefore himself calleth him Lord ; and whence is he then his son ? And the common people heard him gladly .
And he said unto them in his doctrine , Beware of the scribes , which love to go in long clothing , and love salutations in the marketplaces ,
And the chief seats in the synagogues , and the uppermost rooms at feasts :
Which devour widows ' houses , and for a pretence make long prayers : these shall receive greater damnation .
And Jesus sat over against the treasury , and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury : and many that were rich cast in much .
And there came a certain poor widow , and she threw in two mites , which make a farthing .
And he called unto him his disciples , and saith unto them , Verily I say unto you , That this poor widow hath cast more in , than all they which have cast into the treasury :
For all they did cast in of their abundance ; but she of her want did cast in all that she had , even all her living .
And as he went out of the temple , one of his disciples saith unto him , Master , see what manner of stones and what buildings are here !
And Jesus answering said unto him , Seest thou these great buildings ? there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple , Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately ,
Tell us , when shall these things be ? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled ?
And Jesus answering them began to say , Take heed lest any man deceive you :
For many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and shall deceive many .
And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars , be ye not troubled : for such things must needs be ; but the end shall not be yet .
For nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom : and there shall be earthquakes in divers places , and there shall be famines and troubles : these are the beginnings of sorrows .
But take heed to yourselves : for they shall deliver you up to councils ; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten : and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake , for a testimony against them .
And the gospel must first be published among all nations .
But when they shall lead you , and deliver you up , take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak , neither do ye premeditate : but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour , that speak ye : for it is not ye that speak , but the Holy Ghost .
Now the brother shall betray the brother to death , and the father the son ; and children shall rise up against their parents , and shall cause them to be put to death .
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ' s sake : but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be saved .
But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation , spoken of by Daniel the prophet , standing where it ought not , ( let him that readeth understand , ) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains :
And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house , neither enter therein , to take any thing out of his house :
And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment .
But woe to them that are with child , and to them that give suck in those days !
And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter .
For in those days shall be affliction , such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created unto this time , neither shall be .
And except that the Lord had shortened those days , no flesh should be saved : but for the elect ' s sake , whom he hath chosen , he hath shortened the days .
And then if any man shall say to you , Lo , here is Christ ; or , lo , he is there ; believe him not :
For false Christs and false prophets shall rise , and shall shew signs and wonders , to seduce , if it were possible , even the elect .
But take ye heed : behold , I have foretold you all things .
But in those days , after that tribulation , the sun shall be darkened , and the moon shall not give her light ,
And the stars of heaven shall fall , and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken .
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory .
And then shall he send his angels , and shall gather together his elect from the four winds , from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven .
Now learn a parable of the fig tree ; When her branch is yet tender , and putteth forth leaves , ye know that summer is near :
So ye in like manner , when ye shall see these things come to pass , know that it is nigh , even at the doors .
Verily I say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till all these things be done .
Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
But of that day and that hour knoweth no man , no , not the angels which are in heaven , neither the Son , but the Father .
Take ye heed , watch and pray : for ye know not when the time is .
For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey , who left his house , and gave authority to his servants , and to every man his work , and commanded the porter to watch .
Watch ye therefore : for ye know not when the master of the house cometh , at even , or at midnight , or at the cockcrowing , or in the morning :
Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
And what I say unto you I say unto all , Watch .
After two days was the feast of the passover , and of unleavened bread : and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft , and put him to death .
But they said , Not on the feast day , lest there be an uproar of the people .
And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper , as he sat at meat , there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious ; and she brake the box , and poured it on his head .
And there were some that had indignation within themselves , and said , Why was this waste of the ointment made ?
For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence , and have been given to the poor . And they murmured against her .
And Jesus said , Let her alone ; why trouble ye her ? she hath wrought a good work on me .
For ye have the poor with you always , and whensoever ye will ye may do them good : but me ye have not always .
She hath done what she could : she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying .
Verily I say unto you , Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world , this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her .
And Judas Iscariot , one of the twelve , went unto the chief priests , to betray him unto them .
And when they heard it , they were glad , and promised to give him money . And he sought how he might conveniently betray him .
And the first day of unleavened bread , when they killed the passover , his disciples said unto him , Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover ?
And he sendeth forth two of his disciples , and saith unto them , Go ye into the city , and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water : follow him .
And wheresoever he shall go in , say ye to the goodman of the house , The Master saith , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared : there make ready for us .
And his disciples went forth , and came into the city , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
And in the evening he cometh with the twelve .
And as they sat and did eat , Jesus said , Verily I say unto you , One of you which eateth with me shall betray me .
And they began to be sorrowful , and to say unto him one by one , Is it I ? and another said , Is it I ?
And he answered and said unto them , It is one of the twelve , that dippeth with me in the dish .
The Son of man indeed goeth , as it is written of him : but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed ! good were it for that man if he had never been born .
And as they did eat , Jesus took bread , and blessed , and brake it , and gave to them , and said , Take , eat : this is my body .
And he took the cup , and when he had given thanks , he gave it to them : and they all drank of it .
And he said unto them , This is my blood of the new testament , which is shed for many .
Verily I say unto you , I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine , until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God .
And when they had sung an hymn , they went out into the mount of Olives .
And Jesus saith unto them , All ye shall be offended because of me this night : for it is written , I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep shall be scattered .
But after that I am risen , I will go before you into Galilee .
But Peter said unto him , Although all shall be offended , yet will not I .
And Jesus saith unto him , Verily I say unto thee , That this day , even in this night , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice .
But he spake the more vehemently , If I should die with thee , I will not deny thee in any wise . Likewise also said they all .
And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane : and he saith to his disciples , Sit ye here , while I shall pray .
And he taketh with him Peter and James and John , and began to be sore amazed , and to be very heavy ;
And saith unto them , My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death : tarry ye here , and watch .
And he went forward a little , and fell on the ground , and prayed that , if it were possible , the hour might pass from him .
And he said , Abba , Father , all things are possible unto thee ; take away this cup from me : nevertheless not what I will , but what thou wilt .
And he cometh , and findeth them sleeping , and saith unto Peter , Simon , sleepest thou ? couldest not thou watch one hour ?
Watch ye and pray , lest ye enter into temptation . The spirit truly is ready , but the flesh is weak .
And again he went away , and prayed , and spake the same words .
And when he returned , he found them asleep again , ( for their eyes were heavy , ) neither wist they what to answer him .
And he cometh the third time , and saith unto them , Sleep on now , and take your rest : it is enough , the hour is come ; behold , the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners .
Rise up , let us go ; lo , he that betrayeth me is at hand .
And immediately , while he yet spake , cometh Judas , one of the twelve , and with him a great multitude with swords and staves , from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders .
And he that betrayed him had given them a token , saying , Whomsoever I shall kiss , that same is he ; take him , and lead him away safely .
And as soon as he was come , he goeth straightway to him , and saith , Master , master ; and kissed him .
And they laid their hands on him , and took him .
And one of them that stood by drew a sword , and smote a servant of the high priest , and cut off his ear .
And Jesus answered and said unto them , Are ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and with staves to take me ?
I was daily with you in the temple teaching , and ye took me not : but the scriptures must be fulfilled .
And they all forsook him , and fled .
And there followed him a certain young man , having a linen cloth cast about his naked body ; and the young men laid hold on him :
And he left the linen cloth , and fled from them naked .
And they led Jesus away to the high priest : and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes .
And Peter followed him afar off , even into the palace of the high priest : and he sat with the servants , and warmed himself at the fire .
And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death ; and found none .
For many bare false witness against him , but their witness agreed not together .
And there arose certain , and bare false witness against him , saying ,
We heard him say , I will destroy this temple that is made with hands , and within three days I will build another made without hands .
But neither so did their witness agree together .
And the high priest stood up in the midst , and asked Jesus , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? what is it which these witness against thee ?
But he held his peace , and answered nothing . Again the high priest asked him , and said unto him , Art thou the Christ , the Son of the Blessed ?
And Jesus said , I am : and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power , and coming in the clouds of heaven .
Then the high priest rent his clothes , and saith , What need we any further witnesses ?
Ye have heard the blasphemy : what think ye ? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death .
And some began to spit on him , and to cover his face , and to buffet him , and to say unto him , Prophesy : and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands .
And as Peter was beneath in the palace , there cometh one of the maids of the high priest :
And when she saw Peter warming himself , she looked upon him , and said , And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth .
But he denied , saying , I know not , neither understand I what thou sayest . And he went out into the porch ; and the cock crew .
And a maid saw him again , and began to say to them that stood by , This is one of them .
And he denied it again . And a little after , they that stood by said again to Peter , Surely thou art one of them : for thou art a Galilaean , and thy speech agreeth thereto .
But he began to curse and to swear , saying , I know not this man of whom ye speak .
And the second time the cock crew . And Peter called to mind the word that Jesus said unto him , Before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny me thrice . And when he thought thereon , he wept .
And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council , and bound Jesus , and carried him away , and delivered him to Pilate .
And Pilate asked him , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answering said unto them , Thou sayest it .
And the chief priests accused him of many things : but he answered nothing .
And Pilate asked him again , saying , Answerest thou nothing ? behold how many things they witness against thee .
But Jesus yet answered nothing ; so that Pilate marvelled .
Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner , whomsoever they desired .
And there was one named Barabbas , which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him , who had committed murder in the insurrection .
And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them .
But Pilate answered them , saying , Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy .
But the chief priests moved the people , that he should rather release Barabbas unto them .
And Pilate answered and said again unto them , What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews ?
And they cried out again , Crucify him .
Then Pilate said unto them , Why , what evil hath he done ? And they cried out the more exceedingly , Crucify him .
And so Pilate , willing to content the people , released Barabbas unto them , and delivered Jesus , when he had scourged him , to be crucified .
And the soldiers led him away into the hall , called Praetorium ; and they call together the whole band .
And they clothed him with purple , and platted a crown of thorns , and put it about his head ,
And began to salute him , Hail , King of the Jews !
And they smote him on the head with a reed , and did spit upon him , and bowing their knees worshipped him .
And when they had mocked him , they took off the purple from him , and put his own clothes on him , and led him out to crucify him .
And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian , who passed by , coming out of the country , the father of Alexander and Rufus , to bear his cross .
And they bring him unto the place Golgotha , which is , being interpreted , The place of a skull .
And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh : but he received it not .
And when they had crucified him , they parted his garments , casting lots upon them , what every man should take .
And it was the third hour , and they crucified him .
And the superscription of his accusation was written over , THE KING OF THE JEWS .
And with him they crucify two thieves ; the one on his right hand , and the other on his left .
And the scripture was fulfilled , which saith , And he was numbered with the transgressors .
And they that passed by railed on him , wagging their heads , and saying , Ah , thou that destroyest the temple , and buildest it in three days ,
Save thyself , and come down from the cross .
Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes , He saved others ; himself he cannot save .
Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross , that we may see and believe . And they that were crucified with him reviled him .
And when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour .
And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice , saying , Eloi , Eloi , lama sabachthani ? which is , being interpreted , My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ?
And some of them that stood by , when they heard it , said , Behold , he calleth Elias .
And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar , and put it on a reed , and gave him to drink , saying , Let alone ; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down .
And Jesus cried with a loud voice , and gave up the ghost .
And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom .
And when the centurion , which stood over against him , saw that he so cried out , and gave up the ghost , he said , Truly this man was the Son of God .
There were also women looking on afar off : among whom was Mary Magdalene , and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses , and Salome ;
( Who also , when he was in Galilee , followed him , and ministered unto him ; ) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem .
And now when the even was come , because it was the preparation , that is , the day before the sabbath ,
Joseph of Arimathaea , an honourable counsellor , which also waited for the kingdom of God , came , and went in boldly unto Pilate , and craved the body of Jesus .
And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead : and calling unto him the centurion , he asked him whether he had been any while dead .
And when he knew it of the centurion , he gave the body to Joseph .
And he bought fine linen , and took him down , and wrapped him in the linen , and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock , and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre .
And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid .
Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us ,
Even as they delivered them unto us , which from the beginning were eyewitnesses , and ministers of the word ;
It seemed good to me also , having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first , to write unto thee in order , most excellent Theophilus ,
That thou mightest know the certainty of those things , wherein thou hast been instructed .
THERE was in the days of Herod , the king of Judaea , a certain priest named Zacharias , of the course of Abia : and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron , and her name was Elisabeth .
And they were both righteous before God , walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless .
And they had no child , because that Elisabeth was barren , and they both were now well stricken in years .
And it came to pass , that while he executed the priest ' s office before God in the order of his course ,
According to the custom of the priest ' s office , his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord .
And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense .
And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
And when Zacharias saw him , he was troubled , and fear fell upon him .
But the angel said unto him , Fear not , Zacharias : for thy prayer is heard ; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son , and thou shalt call his name John .
And thou shalt have joy and gladness ; and many shall rejoice at his birth .
For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord , and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink ; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost , even from his mother ' s womb .
And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God .
And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias , to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children , and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just ; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord .
And Zacharias said unto the angel , Whereby shall I know this ? for I am an old man , and my wife well stricken in years .
And the angel answering said unto him , I am Gabriel , that stand in the presence of God ; and am sent to speak unto thee , and to shew thee these glad tidings .
And , behold , thou shalt be dumb , and not able to speak , until the day that these things shall be performed , because thou believest not my words , which shall be fulfilled in their season .
And the people waited for Zacharias , and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple .
And when he came out , he could not speak unto them : and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple : for he beckoned unto them , and remained speechless .
And it came to pass , that , as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished , he departed to his own house .
And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived , and hid herself five months , saying ,
Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me , to take away my reproach among men .
And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee , named Nazareth ,
To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph , of the house of David ; and the virgin ' s name was Mary .
And the angel came in unto her , and said , Hail , thou that art highly favoured , the Lord is with thee : blessed art thou among women .
And when she saw him , she was troubled at his saying , and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be .
And the angel said unto her , Fear not , Mary : for thou hast found favour with God .
And , behold , thou shalt conceive in thy womb , and bring forth a son , and shalt call his name JESUS .
He shall be great , and shall be called the Son of the Highest : and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David :
And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his kingdom there shall be no end .
Then said Mary unto the angel , How shall this be , seeing I know not a man ?
And the angel answered and said unto her , The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee , and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee : therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God .
And , behold , thy cousin Elisabeth , she hath also conceived a son in her old age : and this is the sixth month with her , who was called barren .
For with God nothing shall be impossible .
And Mary said , Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it unto me according to thy word . And the angel departed from her .
And Mary arose in those days , and went into the hill country with haste , into a city of Juda ;
And entered into the house of Zacharias , and saluted Elisabeth .
And it came to pass , that , when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary , the babe leaped in her womb ; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost :
And she spake out with a loud voice , and said , Blessed art thou among women , and blessed is the fruit of thy womb .
And whence is this to me , that the mother of my Lord should come to me ?
For , lo , as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears , the babe leaped in my womb for joy .
And blessed is she that believed : for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord .
And Mary said , My soul doth magnify the Lord ,
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour .
For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden : for , behold , from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed .
For he that is mighty hath done to me great things ; and holy is his name .
And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation .
He hath shewed strength with his arm ; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts .
He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and exalted them of low degree .
He hath filled the hungry with good things ; and the rich he hath sent empty away .
He hath holpen his servant Israel , in remembrance of his mercy ;
As he spake to our fathers , to Abraham , and to his seed for ever .
And Mary abode with her about three months , and returned to her own house .
Now Elisabeth ' s full time came that she should be delivered ; and she brought forth a son .
And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her ; and they rejoiced with her .
And it came to pass , that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child ; and they called him Zacharias , after the name of his father .
And his mother answered and said , Not so ; but he shall be called John .
And they said unto her , There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name .
And they made signs to his father , how he would have him called .
And he asked for a writing table , and wrote , saying , His name is John . And they marvelled all .
And his mouth was opened immediately , and his tongue loosed , and he spake , and praised God .
And fear came on all that dwelt round about them : and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea .
And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts , saying , What manner of child shall this be ! And the hand of the Lord was with him .
And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost , and prophesied , saying ,
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel ; for he hath visited and redeemed his people ,
And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David ;
As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets , which have been since the world began :
That we should be saved from our enemies , and from the hand of all that hate us ;
To perform the mercy promised to our fathers , and to remember his holy covenant ;
The oath which he sware to our father Abraham ,
That he would grant unto us , that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear ,
In holiness and righteousness before him , all the days of our life .
And thou , child , shalt be called the prophet of the Highest : for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways ;
To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins ,
Through the tender mercy of our God ; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us ,
To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death , to guide our feet into the way of peace .
And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel .
And it came to pass in those days , that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed .
( And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria . )
And all went to be taxed , every one into his own city .
And Joseph also went up from Galilee , out of the city of Nazareth , into Judaea , unto the city of David , which is called Bethlehem ; ( because he was of the house and lineage of David : )
To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife , being great with child .
And so it was , that , while they were there , the days were accomplished that she should be delivered .
And she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes , and laid him in a manger ; because there was no room for them in the inn .
And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field , keeping watch over their flock by night .
And , lo , the angel of the Lord came upon them , and the glory of the Lord shone round about them : and they were sore afraid .
And the angel said unto them , Fear not : for , behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people .
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour , which is Christ the Lord .
And this shall be a sign unto you ; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes , lying in a manger .
And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God , and saying ,
Glory to God in the highest , and on earth peace , good will toward men .
And it came to pass , as the angels were gone away from them into heaven , the shepherds said one to another , Let us now go even unto Bethlehem , and see this thing which is come to pass , which the Lord hath made known unto us .
And they came with haste , and found Mary , and Joseph , and the babe lying in a manger .
And when they had seen it , they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child .
And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds .
But Mary kept all these things , and pondered them in her heart .
And the shepherds returned , glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen , as it was told unto them .
And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child , his name was called JESUS , which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb .
And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished , they brought him to Jerusalem , to present him to the Lord ;
( As it is written in the law of the LORD , Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord ; )
And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord , A pair of turtledoves , or two young pigeons .
And , behold , there was a man in Jerusalem , whose name was Simeon ; and the same man was just and devout , waiting for the consolation of Israel : and the Holy Ghost was upon him .
And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost , that he should not see death , before he had seen the Lord ' s Christ .
And he came by the Spirit into the temple : and when the parents brought in the child Jesus , to do for him after the custom of the law ,
Then took he him up in his arms , and blessed God , and said ,
Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , according to thy word :
For mine eyes have seen thy salvation ,
Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people ;
A light to lighten the Gentiles , and the glory of thy people Israel .
And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him .
And Simeon blessed them , and said unto Mary his mother , Behold , this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel ; and for a sign which shall be spoken against ;
( Yea , a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also , ) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed .
And there was one Anna , a prophetess , the daughter of Phanuel , of the tribe of Aser : she was of a great age , and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity ;
And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years , which departed not from the temple , but served God with fastings and prayers night and day .
And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord , and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem .
And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord , they returned into Galilee , to their own city Nazareth .
And the child grew , and waxed strong in spirit , filled with wisdom : and the grace of God was upon him .
Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover .
And when he was twelve years old , they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast .
And when they had fulfilled the days , as they returned , the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem ; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it .
But they , supposing him to have been in the company , went a day ' s journey ; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance .
And when they found him not , they turned back again to Jerusalem , seeking him .
And it came to pass , that after three days they found him in the temple , sitting in the midst of the doctors , both hearing them , and asking them questions .
And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers .
And when they saw him , they were amazed : and his mother said unto him , Son , why hast thou thus dealt with us ? behold , thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing .
And he said unto them , How is it that ye sought me ? wist ye not that I must be about my Father ' s business ?
And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them .
And he went down with them , and came to Nazareth , and was subject unto them : but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart .
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favour with God and man .
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar , Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea , and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee , and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis , and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene ,
Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests , the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness .
And he came into all the country about Jordan , preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins ;
As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet , saying , The voice of one crying in the wilderness , Prepare ye the way of the Lord , make his paths straight .
Every valley shall be filled , and every mountain and hill shall be brought low ; and the crooked shall be made straight , and the rough ways shall be made smooth ;
And all flesh shall see the salvation of God .
Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him , O generation of vipers , who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come ?
Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance , and begin not to say within yourselves , We have Abraham to our father : for I say unto you , That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham .
And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees : every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down , and cast into the fire .
And the people asked him , saying , What shall we do then ?
He answereth and saith unto them , He that hath two coats , let him impart to him that hath none ; and he that hath meat , let him do likewise .
Then came also publicans to be baptized , and said unto him , Master , what shall we do ?
And he said unto them , Exact no more than that which is appointed you .
And the soldiers likewise demanded of him , saying , And what shall we do ? And he said unto them , Do violence to no man , neither accuse any falsely ; and be content with your wages .
And as the people were in expectation , and all men mused in their hearts of John , whether he were the Christ , or not ;
John answered , saying unto them all , I indeed baptize you with water ; but one mightier than I cometh , the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose : he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire :
Whose fan is in his hand , and he will throughly purge his floor , and will gather the wheat into his garner ; but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable .
And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people .
But Herod the tetrarch , being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip ' s wife , and for all the evils which Herod had done ,
Added yet this above all , that he shut up John in prison .
Now when all the people were baptized , it came to pass , that Jesus also being baptized , and praying , the heaven was opened ,
And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him , and a voice came from heaven , which said , Thou art my beloved Son ; in thee I am well pleased .
And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age , being ( as was supposed ) the son of Joseph , which was the son of Heli ,
Which was the son of Matthat , which was the son of Levi , which was the son of Melchi , which was the son of Janna , which was the son of Joseph ,

Which was the son of Jesse , which was the son of Obed , which was the son of Booz , which was the son of Salmon , which was the son of Naasson ,

Which was the son of Jacob , which was the son of Isaac , which was the son of Abraham , which was the son of Thara , which was the son of Nachor ,
Which was the son of Saruch , which was the son of Ragau , which was the son of Phalec , which was the son of Heber , which was the son of Sala ,
Which was the son of Cainan , which was the son of Arphaxad , which was the son of Sem , which was the son of Noe , which was the son of Lamech ,

Which was the son of Enos , which was the son of Seth , which was the son of Adam , which was the son of God .
And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan , and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness ,
Being forty days tempted of the devil . And in those days he did eat nothing : and when they were ended , he afterward hungered .
And the devil said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , command this stone that it be made bread .
And Jesus answered him , saying , It is written , That man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God .
And the devil , taking him up into an high mountain , shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time .
And the devil said unto him , All this power will I give thee , and the glory of them : for that is delivered unto me ; and to whomsoever I will I give it .
If thou therefore wilt worship me , all shall be thine .
And Jesus answered and said unto him , Get thee behind me , Satan : for it is written , Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God , and him only shalt thou serve .
And he brought him to Jerusalem , and set him on a pinnacle of the temple , and said unto him , If thou be the Son of God , cast thyself down from hence :
For it is written , He shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee :
And in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone .
And Jesus answering said unto him , It is said , Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God .
And when the devil had ended all the temptation , he departed from him for a season .
And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee : and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about .
And he taught in their synagogues , being glorified of all .
And he came to Nazareth , where he had been brought up : and , as his custom was , he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and stood up for to read .
And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias . And when he had opened the book , he found the place where it was written ,
The Spirit of the Lord is upon me , because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor ; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted , to preach deliverance to the captives , and recovering of sight to the blind , to set at liberty them that are bruised ,
To preach the acceptable year of the Lord .
And he closed the book , and he gave it again to the minister , and sat down . And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him .
And he began to say unto them , This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears .
And all bare him witness , and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth . And they said , Is not this Joseph ' s son ?
And he said unto them , Ye will surely say unto me this proverb , Physician , heal thyself : whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum , do also here in thy country .
And he said , Verily I say unto you , No prophet is accepted in his own country .
But I tell you of a truth , many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias , when the heaven was shut up three years and six months , when great famine was throughout all the land ;
But unto none of them was Elias sent , save unto Sarepta , a city of Sidon , unto a woman that was a widow .
And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet ; and none of them was cleansed , saving Naaman the Syrian .
And all they in the synagogue , when they heard these things , were filled with wrath ,
And rose up , and thrust him out of the city , and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built , that they might cast him down headlong .
But he passing through the midst of them went his way ,
And came down to Capernaum , a city of Galilee , and taught them on the sabbath days .
And they were astonished at his doctrine : for his word was with power .
And in the synagogue there was a man , which had a spirit of an unclean devil , and cried out with a loud voice ,
Saying , Let us alone ; what have we to do with thee , thou Jesus of Nazareth ? art thou come to destroy us ? I know thee who thou art ; the Holy One of God .
And Jesus rebuked him , saying , Hold thy peace , and come out of him . And when the devil had thrown him in the midst , he came out of him , and hurt him not .
And they were all amazed , and spake among themselves , saying , What a word is this ! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits , and they come out .
And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about .
And he arose out of the synagogue , and entered into Simon ' s house . And Simon ' s wife ' s mother was taken with a great fever ; and they besought him for her .
And he stood over her , and rebuked the fever ; and it left her : and immediately she arose and ministered unto them .
Now when the sun was setting , all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him ; and he laid his hands on every one of them , and healed them .
And devils also came out of many , crying out , and saying , Thou art Christ the Son of God . And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak : for they knew that he was Christ .
And when it was day , he departed and went into a desert place : and the people sought him , and came unto him , and stayed him , that he should not depart from them .
And he said unto them , I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also : for therefore am I sent .
And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee .
And it came to pass , that , as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God , he stood by the lake of Gennesaret ,
And saw two ships standing by the lake : but the fishermen were gone out of them , and were washing their nets .
And he entered into one of the ships , which was Simon ' s , and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land . And he sat down , and taught the people out of the ship .
Now when he had left speaking , he said unto Simon , Launch out into the deep , and let down your nets for a draught .
And Simon answering said unto him , Master , we have toiled all the night , and have taken nothing : nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net .
And when they had this done , they inclosed a great multitude of fishes : and their net brake .
And they beckoned unto their partners , which were in the other ship , that they should come and help them . And they came , and filled both the ships , so that they began to sink .
When Simon Peter saw it , he fell down at Jesus ' knees , saying , Depart from me ; for I am a sinful man , O Lord .
For he was astonished , and all that were with him , at the draught of the fishes which they had taken :
And so was also James , and John , the sons of Zebedee , which were partners with Simon . And Jesus said unto Simon , Fear not ; from henceforth thou shalt catch men .
And when they had brought their ships to land , they forsook all , and followed him .
And it came to pass , when he was in a certain city , behold a man full of leprosy : who seeing Jesus fell on his face , and besought him , saying , Lord , if thou wilt , thou canst make me clean .
And he put forth his hand , and touched him , saying , I will : be thou clean . And immediately the leprosy departed from him .
And he charged him to tell no man : but go , and shew thyself to the priest , and offer for thy cleansing , according as Moses commanded , for a testimony unto them .
But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him : and great multitudes came together to hear , and to be healed by him of their infirmities .
And he withdrew himself into the wilderness , and prayed .
And it came to pass on a certain day , as he was teaching , that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by , which were come out of every town of Galilee , and Judaea , and Jerusalem : and the power of the Lord was present to heal them .
And , behold , men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy : and they sought means to bring him in , and to lay him before him .
And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude , they went upon the housetop , and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus .
And when he saw their faith , he said unto him , Man , thy sins are forgiven thee .
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason , saying , Who is this which speaketh blasphemies ? Who can forgive sins , but God alone ?
But when Jesus perceived their thoughts , he answering said unto them , What reason ye in your hearts ?
Whether is easier , to say , Thy sins be forgiven thee ; or to say , Rise up and walk ?
But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins , ( he said unto the sick of the palsy , ) I say unto thee , Arise , and take up thy couch , and go into thine house .
And immediately he rose up before them , and took up that whereon he lay , and departed to his own house , glorifying God .
And they were all amazed , and they glorified God , and were filled with fear , saying , We have seen strange things to day .
And after these things he went forth , and saw a publican , named Levi , sitting at the receipt of custom : and he said unto him , Follow me .
And he left all , rose up , and followed him .
And Levi made him a great feast in his own house : and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them .
But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples , saying , Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners ?
And Jesus answering said unto them , They that are whole need not a physician ; but they that are sick .
I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance .
And they said unto him , Why do the disciples of John fast often , and make prayers , and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees ; but thine eat and drink ?
And he said unto them , Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast , while the bridegroom is with them ?
But the days will come , when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them , and then shall they fast in those days .
And he spake also a parable unto them ; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old ; if otherwise , then both the new maketh a rent , and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old .
And no man putteth new wine into old bottles ; else the new wine will burst the bottles , and be spilled , and the bottles shall perish .
But new wine must be put into new bottles ; and both are preserved .
No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new : for he saith , The old is better .
And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first , that he went through the corn fields ; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn , and did eat , rubbing them in their hands .
And certain of the Pharisees said unto them , Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days ?
And Jesus answering them said , Have ye not read so much as this , what David did , when himself was an hungred , and they which were with him ;
How he went into the house of God , and did take and eat the shewbread , and gave also to them that were with him ; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone ?
And he said unto them , That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath .
And it came to pass also on another sabbath , that he entered into the synagogue and taught : and there was a man whose right hand was withered .
And the scribes and Pharisees watched him , whether he would heal on the sabbath day ; that they might find an accusation against him .
But he knew their thoughts , and said to the man which had the withered hand , Rise up , and stand forth in the midst . And he arose and stood forth .
Then said Jesus unto them , I will ask you one thing ; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good , or to do evil ? to save life , or to destroy it ?
And looking round about upon them all , he said unto the man , Stretch forth thy hand . And he did so : and his hand was restored whole as the other .
And they were filled with madness ; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus .
And it came to pass in those days , that he went out into a mountain to pray , and continued all night in prayer to God .
And when it was day , he called unto him his disciples : and of them he chose twelve , whom also he named apostles ;
Simon , ( whom he also named Peter , ) and Andrew his brother , James and John , Philip and Bartholomew ,
Matthew and Thomas , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon called Zelotes ,
And Judas the brother of James , and Judas Iscariot , which also was the traitor .
And he came down with them , and stood in the plain , and the company of his disciples , and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem , and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon , which came to hear him , and to be healed of their diseases ;
And they that were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed .
And the whole multitude sought to touch him : for there went virtue out of him , and healed them all .
And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples , and said , Blessed be ye poor : for yours is the kingdom of God .
Blessed are ye that hunger now : for ye shall be filled . Blessed are ye that weep now : for ye shall laugh .
Blessed are ye , when men shall hate you , and when they shall separate you from their company , and shall reproach you , and cast out your name as evil , for the Son of man ' s sake .
Rejoice ye in that day , and leap for joy : for , behold , your reward is great in heaven : for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets .
But woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation .
Woe unto you that are full ! for ye shall hunger . Woe unto you that laugh now ! for ye shall mourn and weep .
Woe unto you , when all men shall speak well of you ! for so did their fathers to the false prophets .
But I say unto you which hear , Love your enemies , do good to them which hate you ,
Bless them that curse you , and pray for them which despitefully use you .
And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other ; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also .
Give to every man that asketh of thee ; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again .
And as ye would that men should do to you , do ye also to them likewise .
For if ye love them which love you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also love those that love them .
And if ye do good to them which do good to you , what thank have ye ? for sinners also do even the same .
And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive , what thank have ye ? for sinners also lend to sinners , to receive as much again .
But love ye your enemies , and do good , and lend , hoping for nothing again ; and your reward shall be great , and ye shall be the children of the Highest : for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil .
Be ye therefore merciful , as your Father also is merciful .
Judge not , and ye shall not be judged : condemn not , and ye shall not be condemned : forgive , and ye shall be forgiven :
Give , and it shall be given unto you ; good measure , pressed down , and shaken together , and running over , shall men give into your bosom . For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again .
And he spake a parable unto them , Can the blind lead the blind ? shall they not both fall into the ditch ?
The disciple is not above his master : but every one that is perfect shall be as his master .
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother ' s eye , but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye ?
Either how canst thou say to thy brother , Brother , let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye , when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye ? Thou hypocrite , cast out first the beam out of thine own eye , and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother ' s eye .
For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit ; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit .
For every tree is known by his own fruit . For of thorns men do not gather figs , nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes .
A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil : for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh .
And why call ye me , Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ?
Whosoever cometh to me , and heareth my sayings , and doeth them , I will shew you to whom he is like :
He is like a man which built an house , and digged deep , and laid the foundation on a rock : and when the flood arose , the stream beat vehemently upon that house , and could not shake it : for it was founded upon a rock .
But he that heareth , and doeth not , is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth ; against which the stream did beat vehemently , and immediately it fell ; and the ruin of that house was great .
Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people , he entered into Capernaum .
And a certain centurion ' s servant , who was dear unto him , was sick , and ready to die .
And when he heard of Jesus , he sent unto him the elders of the Jews , beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant .
And when they came to Jesus , they besought him instantly , saying , That he was worthy for whom he should do this :
For he loveth our nation , and he hath built us a synagogue .
Then Jesus went with them . And when he was now not far from the house , the centurion sent friends to him , saying unto him , Lord , trouble not thyself : for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof :
Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee : but say in a word , and my servant shall be healed .
For I also am a man set under authority , having under me soldiers , and I say unto one , Go , and he goeth ; and to another , Come , and he cometh ; and to my servant , Do this , and he doeth it .
When Jesus heard these things , he marvelled at him , and turned him about , and said unto the people that followed him , I say unto you , I have not found so great faith , no , not in Israel .
And they that were sent , returning to the house , found the servant whole that had been sick .
And it came to pass the day after , that he went into a city called Nain ; and many of his disciples went with him , and much people .
Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city , behold , there was a dead man carried out , the only son of his mother , and she was a widow : and much people of the city was with her .
And when the Lord saw her , he had compassion on her , and said unto her , Weep not .
And he came and touched the bier : and they that bare him stood still . And he said , Young man , I say unto thee , Arise .
And he that was dead sat up , and began to speak . And he delivered him to his mother .
And there came a fear on all : and they glorified God , saying , That a great prophet is risen up among us ; and , That God hath visited his people .
And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea , and throughout all the region round about .
And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things .
And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
When the men were come unto him , they said , John Baptist hath sent us unto thee , saying , Art thou he that should come ? or look we for another ?
And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues , and of evil spirits ; and unto many that were blind he gave sight .
Then Jesus answering said unto them , Go your way , and tell John what things ye have seen and heard ; how that the blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead are raised , to the poor the gospel is preached .
And blessed is he , whosoever shall not be offended in me .
And when the messengers of John were departed , he began to speak unto the people concerning John , What went ye out into the wilderness for to see ? A reed shaken with the wind ?
But what went ye out for to see ? A man clothed in soft raiment ? Behold , they which are gorgeously apparelled , and live delicately , are in kings ' courts .
But what went ye out for to see ? A prophet ? Yea , I say unto you , and much more than a prophet .
This is he , of whom it is written , Behold , I send my messenger before thy face , which shall prepare thy way before thee .
For I say unto you , Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist : but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he .
And all the people that heard him , and the publicans , justified God , being baptized with the baptism of John .
But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves , being not baptized of him .
And the Lord said , Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation ? and to what are they like ?
They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace , and calling one to another , and saying , We have piped unto you , and ye have not danced ; we have mourned to you , and ye have not wept .
For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine ; and ye say , He hath a devil .
The Son of man is come eating and drinking ; and ye say , Behold a gluttonous man , and a winebibber , a friend of publicans and sinners !
But wisdom is justified of all her children .
And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him . And he went into the Pharisee ' s house , and sat down to meat .
And , behold , a woman in the city , which was a sinner , when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee ' s house , brought an alabaster box of ointment ,
And stood at his feet behind him weeping , and began to wash his feet with tears , and did wipe them with the hairs of her head , and kissed his feet , and anointed them with the ointment .
Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it , he spake within himself , saying , This man , if he were a prophet , would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him : for she is a sinner .
And Jesus answering said unto him , Simon , I have somewhat to say unto thee . And he saith , Master , say on .
There was a certain creditor which had two debtors : the one owed five hundred pence , and the other fifty .
And when they had nothing to pay , he frankly forgave them both . Tell me therefore , which of them will love him most ?
Simon answered and said , I suppose that he , to whom he forgave most . And he said unto him , Thou hast rightly judged .
And he turned to the woman , and said unto Simon , Seest thou this woman ? I entered into thine house , thou gavest me no water for my feet : but she hath washed my feet with tears , and wiped them with the hairs of her head .
Thou gavest me no kiss : but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet .
My head with oil thou didst not anoint : but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment .
Wherefore I say unto thee , Her sins , which are many , are forgiven ; for she loved much : but to whom little is forgiven , the same loveth little .
And he said unto her , Thy sins are forgiven .
And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves , Who is this that forgiveth sins also ?
And he said to the woman , Thy faith hath saved thee ; go in peace .
And it came to pass afterward , that he went throughout every city and village , preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God : and the twelve were with him ,
And certain women , which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities , Mary called Magdalene , out of whom went seven devils ,
And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod ' s steward , and Susanna , and many others , which ministered unto him of their substance .
And when much people were gathered together , and were come to him out of every city , he spake by a parable :
A sower went out to sow his seed : and as he sowed , some fell by the way side ; and it was trodden down , and the fowls of the air devoured it .
And some fell upon a rock ; and as soon as it was sprung up , it withered away , because it lacked moisture .
And some fell among thorns ; and the thorns sprang up with it , and choked it .
And other fell on good ground , and sprang up , and bare fruit an hundredfold . And when he had said these things , he cried , He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
And his disciples asked him , saying , What might this parable be ?
And he said , Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God : but to others in parables ; that seeing they might not see , and hearing they might not understand .
Now the parable is this : The seed is the word of God .
Those by the way side are they that hear ; then cometh the devil , and taketh away the word out of their hearts , lest they should believe and be saved .
They on the rock are they , which , when they hear , receive the word with joy ; and these have no root , which for a while believe , and in time of temptation fall away .
And that which fell among thorns are they , which , when they have heard , go forth , and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life , and bring no fruit to perfection .
But that on the good ground are they , which in an honest and good heart , having heard the word , keep it , and bring forth fruit with patience .
No man , when he hath lighted a candle , covereth it with a vessel , or putteth it under a bed ; but setteth it on a candlestick , that they which enter in may see the light .
For nothing is secret , that shall not be made manifest ; neither any thing hid , that shall not be known and come abroad .
Take heed therefore how ye hear : for whosoever hath , to him shall be given ; and whosoever hath not , from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have .
Then came to him his mother and his brethren , and could not come at him for the press .
And it was told him by certain which said , Thy mother and thy brethren stand without , desiring to see thee .
And he answered and said unto them , My mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of God , and do it .
Now it came to pass on a certain day , that he went into a ship with his disciples : and he said unto them , Let us go over unto the other side of the lake . And they launched forth .
But as they sailed he fell asleep : and there came down a storm of wind on the lake ; and they were filled with water , and were in jeopardy .
And they came to him , and awoke him , saying , Master , master , we perish . Then he arose , and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water : and they ceased , and there was a calm .
And he said unto them , Where is your faith ? And they being afraid wondered , saying one to another , What manner of man is this ! for he commandeth even the winds and water , and they obey him .
And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes , which is over against Galilee .
And when he went forth to land , there met him out of the city a certain man , which had devils long time , and ware no clothes , neither abode in any house , but in the tombs .
When he saw Jesus , he cried out , and fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , What have I to do with thee , Jesus , thou Son of God most high ? I beseech thee , torment me not .
( For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man . For oftentimes it had caught him : and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters ; and he brake the bands , and was driven of the devil into the wilderness . )
And Jesus asked him , saying , What is thy name ? And he said , Legion : because many devils were entered into him .
And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep .
And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain : and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them . And he suffered them .
Then went the devils out of the man , and entered into the swine : and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were choked .
When they that fed them saw what was done , they fled , and went and told it in the city and in the country .
Then they went out to see what was done ; and came to Jesus , and found the man , out of whom the devils were departed , sitting at the feet of Jesus , clothed , and in his right mind : and they were afraid .
They also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed .
Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them ; for they were taken with great fear : and he went up into the ship , and returned back again .
Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him : but Jesus sent him away , saying ,
Return to thine own house , and shew how great things God hath done unto thee . And he went his way , and published throughout the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him .
And it came to pass , that , when Jesus was returned , the people gladly received him : for they were all waiting for him .
And , behold , there came a man named Jairus , and he was a ruler of the synagogue : and he fell down at Jesus ' feet , and besought him that he would come into his house :
For he had one only daughter , about twelve years of age , and she lay a dying . But as he went the people thronged him .
And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years , which had spent all her living upon physicians , neither could be healed of any ,
Came behind him , and touched the border of his garment : and immediately her issue of blood stanched .
And Jesus said , Who touched me ? When all denied , Peter and they that were with him said , Master , the multitude throng thee and press thee , and sayest thou , Who touched me ?
And Jesus said , Somebody hath touched me : for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me .
And when the woman saw that she was not hid , she came trembling , and falling down before him , she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him , and how she was healed immediately .
And he said unto her , Daughter , be of good comfort : thy faith hath made thee whole ; go in peace .
While he yet spake , there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogue ' s house , saying to him , Thy daughter is dead ; trouble not the Master .
But when Jesus heard it , he answered him , saying , Fear not : believe only , and she shall be made whole .
And when he came into the house , he suffered no man to go in , save Peter , and James , and John , and the father and the mother of the maiden .
And all wept , and bewailed her : but he said , Weep not ; she is not dead , but sleepeth .
And they laughed him to scorn , knowing that she was dead .
And he put them all out , and took her by the hand , and called , saying , Maid , arise .
And her spirit came again , and she arose straightway : and he commanded to give her meat .
And her parents were astonished : but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done .
Then he called his twelve disciples together , and gave them power and authority over all devils , and to cure diseases .
And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God , and to heal the sick .
And he said unto them , Take nothing for your journey , neither staves , nor scrip , neither bread , neither money ; neither have two coats apiece .
And whatsoever house ye enter into , there abide , and thence depart .
And whosoever will not receive you , when ye go out of that city , shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them .
And they departed , and went through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing every where .
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him : and he was perplexed , because that it was said of some , that John was risen from the dead ;
And of some , that Elias had appeared ; and of others , that one of the old prophets was risen again .
And Herod said , John have I beheaded : but who is this , of whom I hear such things ? And he desired to see him .
And the apostles , when they were returned , told him all that they had done . And he took them , and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida .
And the people , when they knew it , followed him : and he received them , and spake unto them of the kingdom of God , and healed them that had need of healing .
And when the day began to wear away , then came the twelve , and said unto him , Send the multitude away , that they may go into the towns and country round about , and lodge , and get victuals : for we are here in a desert place .
But he said unto them , Give ye them to eat . And they said , We have no more but five loaves and two fishes ; except we should go and buy meat for all this people .
For they were about five thousand men . And he said to his disciples , Make them sit down by fifties in a company .
And they did so , and made them all sit down .
Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes , and looking up to heaven , he blessed them , and brake , and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude .
And they did eat , and were all filled : and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets .
And it came to pass , as he was alone praying , his disciples were with him : and he asked them , saying , Whom say the people that I am ?
They answering said , John the Baptist ; but some say , Elias ; and others say , that one of the old prophets is risen again .
He said unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? Peter answering said , The Christ of God .
And he straitly charged them , and commanded them to tell no man that thing ;
Saying , The Son of man must suffer many things , and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes , and be slain , and be raised the third day .
And he said to them all , If any man will come after me , let him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow me .
For whosoever will save his life shall lose it : but whosoever will lose his life for my sake , the same shall save it .
For what is a man advantaged , if he gain the whole world , and lose himself , or be cast away ?
For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words , of him shall the Son of man be ashamed , when he shall come in his own glory , and in his Father ' s , and of the holy angels .
But I tell you of a truth , there be some standing here , which shall not taste of death , till they see the kingdom of God .
And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings , he took Peter and John and James , and went up into a mountain to pray .
And as he prayed , the fashion of his countenance was altered , and his raiment was white and glistering .
And , behold , there talked with him two men , which were Moses and Elias :
Who appeared in glory , and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem .
But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep : and when they were awake , they saw his glory , and the two men that stood with him .
And it came to pass , as they departed from him , Peter said unto Jesus , Master , it is good for us to be here : and let us make three tabernacles ; one for thee , and one for Moses , and one for Elias : not knowing what he said .
While he thus spake , there came a cloud , and overshadowed them : and they feared as they entered into the cloud .
And there came a voice out of the cloud , saying , This is my beloved Son : hear him .
And when the voice was past , Jesus was found alone . And they kept it close , and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen .
And it came to pass , that on the next day , when they were come down from the hill , much people met him .
And , behold , a man of the company cried out , saying , Master , I beseech thee , look upon my son : for he is mine only child .
And , lo , a spirit taketh him , and he suddenly crieth out ; and it teareth him that he foameth again , and bruising him hardly departeth from him .
And I besought thy disciples to cast him out ; and they could not .
And Jesus answering said , O faithless and perverse generation , how long shall I be with you , and suffer you ? Bring thy son hither .
And as he was yet a coming , the devil threw him down , and tare him . And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit , and healed the child , and delivered him again to his father .
And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God . But while they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did , he said unto his disciples ,
Let these sayings sink down into your ears : for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men .
But they understood not this saying , and it was hid from them , that they perceived it not : and they feared to ask him of that saying .
Then there arose a reasoning among them , which of them should be greatest .
And Jesus , perceiving the thought of their heart , took a child , and set him by him ,
And said unto them , Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me : and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me : for he that is least among you all , the same shall be great .
And John answered and said , Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name ; and we forbad him , because he followeth not with us .
And Jesus said unto him , Forbid him not : for he that is not against us is for us .
And it came to pass , when the time was come that he should be received up , he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem ,
And sent messengers before his face : and they went , and entered into a village of the Samaritans , to make ready for him .
And they did not receive him , because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem .
And when his disciples James and John saw this , they said , Lord , wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven , and consume them , even as Elias did ?
But he turned , and rebuked them , and said , Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of .
For the Son of man is not come to destroy men ' s lives , but to save them . And they went to another village .
And it came to pass , that , as they went in the way , a certain man said unto him , Lord , I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest .
And Jesus said unto him , Foxes have holes , and birds of the air have nests ; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head .
And he said unto another , Follow me . But he said , Lord , suffer me first to go and bury my father .
Jesus said unto him , Let the dead bury their dead : but go thou and preach the kingdom of God .
And another also said , Lord , I will follow thee ; but let me first go bid them farewell , which are at home at my house .
And Jesus said unto him , No man , having put his hand to the plough , and looking back , is fit for the kingdom of God .
After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also , and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place , whither he himself would come .
Therefore said he unto them , The harvest truly is great , but the labourers are few : pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest , that he would send forth labourers into his harvest .
Go your ways : behold , I send you forth as lambs among wolves .
Carry neither purse , nor scrip , nor shoes : and salute no man by the way .
And into whatsoever house ye enter , first say , Peace be to this house .
And if the son of peace be there , your peace shall rest upon it : if not , it shall turn to you again .
And in the same house remain , eating and drinking such things as they give : for the labourer is worthy of his hire . Go not from house to house .
And into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you , eat such things as are set before you :
And heal the sick that are therein , and say unto them , The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
But into whatsoever city ye enter , and they receive you not , go your ways out into the streets of the same , and say ,
Even the very dust of your city , which cleaveth on us , we do wipe off against you : notwithstanding be ye sure of this , that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you .
But I say unto you , that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom , than for that city .
Woe unto thee , Chorazin ! woe unto thee , Bethsaida ! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon , which have been done in you , they had a great while ago repented , sitting in sackcloth and ashes .
But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment , than for you .
And thou , Capernaum , which art exalted to heaven , shalt be thrust down to hell .
He that heareth you heareth me ; and he that despiseth you despiseth me ; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me .
And the seventy returned again with joy , saying , Lord , even the devils are subject unto us through thy name .
And he said unto them , I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven .
Behold , I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions , and over all the power of the enemy : and nothing shall by any means hurt you .
Notwithstanding in this rejoice not , that the spirits are subject unto you ; but rather rejoice , because your names are written in heaven .
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit , and said , I thank thee , O Father , Lord of heaven and earth , that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes : even so , Father ; for so it seemed good in thy sight .
All things are delivered to me of my Father : and no man knoweth who the Son is , but the Father ; and who the Father is , but the Son , and he to whom the Son will reveal him .
And he turned him unto his disciples , and said privately , Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see :
For I tell you , that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see , and have not seen them ; and to hear those things which ye hear , and have not heard them .
And , behold , a certain lawyer stood up , and tempted him , saying , Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ?
He said unto him , What is written in the law ? how readest thou ?
And he answering said , Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart , and with all thy soul , and with all thy strength , and with all thy mind ; and thy neighbour as thyself .
And he said unto him , Thou hast answered right : this do , and thou shalt live .
But he , willing to justify himself , said unto Jesus , And who is my neighbour ?
And Jesus answering said , A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho , and fell among thieves , which stripped him of his raiment , and wounded him , and departed , leaving him half dead .
And by chance there came down a certain priest that way : and when he saw him , he passed by on the other side .
And likewise a Levite , when he was at the place , came and looked on him , and passed by on the other side .
But a certain Samaritan , as he journeyed , came where he was : and when he saw him , he had compassion on him ,
And went to him , and bound up his wounds , pouring in oil and wine , and set him on his own beast , and brought him to an inn , and took care of him .
And on the morrow when he departed , he took out two pence , and gave them to the host , and said unto him , Take care of him ; and whatsoever thou spendest more , when I come again , I will repay thee .
Which now of these three , thinkest thou , was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves ?
And he said , He that shewed mercy on him . Then said Jesus unto him , Go , and do thou likewise .
Now it came to pass , as they went , that he entered into a certain village : and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house .
And she had a sister called Mary , which also sat at Jesus ' feet , and heard his word .
But Martha was cumbered about much serving , and came to him , and said , Lord , dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone ? bid her therefore that she help me .
And Jesus answered and said unto her , Martha , Martha , thou art careful and troubled about many things :
But one thing is needful : and Mary hath chosen that good part , which shall not be taken away from her .
And it came to pass , that , as he was praying in a certain place , when he ceased , one of his disciples said unto him , Lord , teach us to pray , as John also taught his disciples .
And he said unto them , When ye pray , say , Our Father which art in heaven , Hallowed be thy name . Thy kingdom come . Thy will be done , as in heaven , so in earth .
Give us day by day our daily bread .
And forgive us our sins ; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us . And lead us not into temptation ; but deliver us from evil .
And he said unto them , Which of you shall have a friend , and shall go unto him at midnight , and say unto him , Friend , lend me three loaves ;
For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me , and I have nothing to set before him ?
And he from within shall answer and say , Trouble me not : the door is now shut , and my children are with me in bed ; I cannot rise and give thee .
I say unto you , Though he will not rise and give him , because he is his friend , yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth .
And I say unto you , Ask , and it shall be given you ; seek , and ye shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened unto you .
For every one that asketh receiveth ; and he that seeketh findeth ; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened .
If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father , will he give him a stone ? or if he ask a fish , will he for a fish give him a serpent ?
Or if he shall ask an egg , will he offer him a scorpion ?
If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts unto your children : how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him ?
And he was casting out a devil , and it was dumb . And it came to pass , when the devil was gone out , the dumb spake ; and the people wondered .
But some of them said , He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils .
And others , tempting him , sought of him a sign from heaven .
But he , knowing their thoughts , said unto them , Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation ; and a house divided against a house falleth .
If Satan also be divided against himself , how shall his kingdom stand ? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub .
And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils , by whom do your sons cast them out ? therefore shall they be your judges .
But if I with the finger of God cast out devils , no doubt the kingdom of God is come upon you .
When a strong man armed keepeth his palace , his goods are in peace :
But when a stronger than he shall come upon him , and overcome him , he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted , and divideth his spoils .
He that is not with me is against me : and he that gathereth not with me scattereth .
When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man , he walketh through dry places , seeking rest ; and finding none , he saith , I will return unto my house whence I came out .
And when he cometh , he findeth it swept and garnished .
Then goeth he , and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself ; and they enter in , and dwell there : and the last state of that man is worse than the first .
And it came to pass , as he spake these things , a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice , and said unto him , Blessed is the womb that bare thee , and the paps which thou hast sucked .
But he said , Yea rather , blessed are they that hear the word of God , and keep it .
And when the people were gathered thick together , he began to say , This is an evil generation : they seek a sign ; and there shall no sign be given it , but the sign of Jonas the prophet .
For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites , so shall also the Son of man be to this generation .
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation , and condemn them : for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon ; and , behold , a greater than Solomon is here .
The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation , and shall condemn it : for they repented at the preaching of Jonas ; and , behold , a greater than Jonas is here .
No man , when he hath lighted a candle , putteth it in a secret place , neither under a bushel , but on a candlestick , that they which come in may see the light .
The light of the body is the eye : therefore when thine eye is single , thy whole body also is full of light ; but when thine eye is evil , thy body also is full of darkness .
Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness .
If thy whole body therefore be full of light , having no part dark , the whole shall be full of light , as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light .
And as he spake , a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him : and he went in , and sat down to meat .
And when the Pharisee saw it , he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner .
And the Lord said unto him , Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter ; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness .
Ye fools , did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also ?
But rather give alms of such things as ye have ; and , behold , all things are clean unto you .
But woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs , and pass over judgment and the love of God : these ought ye to have done , and not to leave the other undone .
Woe unto you , Pharisees ! for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues , and greetings in the markets .
Woe unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! for ye are as graves which appear not , and the men that walk over them are not aware of them .
Then answered one of the lawyers , and said unto him , Master , thus saying thou reproachest us also .
And he said , Woe unto you also , ye lawyers ! for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne , and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers .
Woe unto you ! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets , and your fathers killed them .
Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers : for they indeed killed them , and ye build their sepulchres .
Therefore also said the wisdom of God , I will send them prophets and apostles , and some of them they shall slay and persecute :
That the blood of all the prophets , which was shed from the foundation of the world , may be required of this generation ;
From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple : verily I say unto you , It shall be required of this generation .
Woe unto you , lawyers ! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves , and them that were entering in ye hindered .
And as he said these things unto them , the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently , and to provoke him to speak of many things :
Laying wait for him , and seeking to catch something out of his mouth , that they might accuse him .
In the mean time , when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people , insomuch that they trode one upon another , he began to say unto his disciples first of all , Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees , which is hypocrisy .
For there is nothing covered , that shall not be revealed ; neither hid , that shall not be known .
Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light ; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops .
And I say unto you my friends , Be not afraid of them that kill the body , and after that have no more that they can do .
But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear : Fear him , which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell ; yea , I say unto you , Fear him .
Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings , and not one of them is forgotten before God ?
But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Fear not therefore : ye are of more value than many sparrows .
Also I say unto you , Whosoever shall confess me before men , him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God :
But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of God .
And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man , it shall be forgiven him : but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven .
And when they bring you unto the synagogues , and unto magistrates , and powers , take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer , or what ye shall say :
For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say .
And one of the company said unto him , Master , speak to my brother , that he divide the inheritance with me .
And he said unto him , Man , who made me a judge or a divider over you ?
And he said unto them , Take heed , and beware of covetousness : for a man ' s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth .
And he spake a parable unto them , saying , The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully :
And he thought within himself , saying , What shall I do , because I have no room where to bestow my fruits ?
And he said , This will I do : I will pull down my barns , and build greater ; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods .
And I will say to my soul , Soul , thou hast much goods laid up for many years ; take thine ease , eat , drink , and be merry .
But God said unto him , Thou fool , this night thy soul shall be required of thee : then whose shall those things be , which thou hast provided ?
So is he that layeth up treasure for himself , and is not rich toward God .
And he said unto his disciples , Therefore I say unto you , Take no thought for your life , what ye shall eat ; neither for the body , what ye shall put on .
The life is more than meat , and the body is more than raiment .
Consider the ravens : for they neither sow nor reap ; which neither have storehouse nor barn ; and God feedeth them : how much more are ye better than the fowls ?
And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit ?
If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least , why take ye thought for the rest ?
Consider the lilies how they grow : they toil not , they spin not ; and yet I say unto you , that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these .
If then God so clothe the grass , which is to day in the field , and to morrow is cast into the oven ; how much more will he clothe you , O ye of little faith ?
And seek not ye what ye shall eat , or what ye shall drink , neither be ye of doubtful mind .
For all these things do the nations of the world seek after : and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things .
But rather seek ye the kingdom of God ; and all these things shall be added unto you .
Fear not , little flock ; for it is your Father ' s good pleasure to give you the kingdom .
Sell that ye have , and give alms ; provide yourselves bags which wax not old , a treasure in the heavens that faileth not , where no thief approacheth , neither moth corrupteth .
For where your treasure is , there will your heart be also .
Let your loins be girded about , and your lights burning ;
And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord , when he will return from the wedding ; that when he cometh and knocketh , they may open unto him immediately .
Blessed are those servants , whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching : verily I say unto you , that he shall gird himself , and make them to sit down to meat , and will come forth and serve them .
And if he shall come in the second watch , or come in the third watch , and find them so , blessed are those servants .
And this know , that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come , he would have watched , and not have suffered his house to be broken through .
Be ye therefore ready also : for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not .
Then Peter said unto him , Lord , speakest thou this parable unto us , or even to all ?
And the Lord said , Who then is that faithful and wise steward , whom his lord shall make ruler over his household , to give them their portion of meat in due season ?
Blessed is that servant , whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing .
Of a truth I say unto you , that he will make him ruler over all that he hath .
But and if that servant say in his heart , My lord delayeth his coming ; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens , and to eat and drink , and to be drunken ;
The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him , and at an hour when he is not aware , and will cut him in sunder , and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers .
And that servant , which knew his lord ' s will , and prepared not himself , neither did according to his will , shall be beaten with many stripes .
But he that knew not , and did commit things worthy of stripes , shall be beaten with few stripes . For unto whomsoever much is given , of him shall be much required : and to whom men have committed much , of him they will ask the more .
I am come to send fire on the earth ; and what will I , if it be already kindled ?
But I have a baptism to be baptized with ; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished !
Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth ? I tell you , Nay ; but rather division :
For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided , three against two , and two against three .
The father shall be divided against the son , and the son against the father ; the mother against the daughter , and the daughter against the mother ; the mother in law against her daughter in law , and the daughter in law against her mother in law .
And he said also to the people , When ye see a cloud rise out of the west , straightway ye say , There cometh a shower ; and so it is .
And when ye see the south wind blow , ye say , There will be heat ; and it cometh to pass .
Ye hypocrites , ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth ; but how is it that ye do not discern this time ?
Yea , and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate , as thou art in the way , give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him ; lest he hale thee to the judge , and the judge deliver thee to the officer , and the officer cast thee into prison .
I tell thee , thou shalt not depart thence , till thou hast paid the very last mite .
There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans , whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices .
And Jesus answering said unto them , Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans , because they suffered such things ?
I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
Or those eighteen , upon whom the tower in Siloam fell , and slew them , think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem ?
I tell you , Nay : but , except ye repent , ye shall all likewise perish .
He spake also this parable ; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard ; and he came and sought fruit thereon , and found none .
Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard , Behold , these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none : cut it down ; why cumbereth it the ground ?
And he answering said unto him , Lord , let it alone this year also , till I shall dig about it , and dung it :
And if it bear fruit , well : and if not , then after that thou shalt cut it down .
And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath .
And , behold , there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years , and was bowed together , and could in no wise lift up herself .
And when Jesus saw her , he called her to him , and said unto her , Woman , thou art loosed from thine infirmity .
And he laid his hands on her : and immediately she was made straight , and glorified God .
And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation , because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day , and said unto the people , There are six days in which men ought to work : in them therefore come and be healed , and not on the sabbath day .
The Lord then answered him , and said , Thou hypocrite , doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall , and lead him away to watering ?
And ought not this woman , being a daughter of Abraham , whom Satan hath bound , lo , these eighteen years , be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day ?
And when he had said these things , all his adversaries were ashamed : and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him .
Then said he , Unto what is the kingdom of God like ? and whereunto shall I resemble it ?
It is like a grain of mustard seed , which a man took , and cast into his garden ; and it grew , and waxed a great tree ; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it .
And again he said , Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God ?
It is like leaven , which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal , till the whole was leavened .
And he went through the cities and villages , teaching , and journeying toward Jerusalem .
Then said one unto him , Lord , are there few that be saved ? And he said unto them ,
Strive to enter in at the strait gate : for many , I say unto you , will seek to enter in , and shall not be able .
When once the master of the house is risen up , and hath shut to the door , and ye begin to stand without , and to knock at the door , saying , Lord , Lord , open unto us ; and he shall answer and say unto you , I know you not whence ye are :
Then shall ye begin to say , We have eaten and drunk in thy presence , and thou hast taught in our streets .
But he shall say , I tell you , I know you not whence ye are ; depart from me , all ye workers of iniquity .
There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth , when ye shall see Abraham , and Isaac , and Jacob , and all the prophets , in the kingdom of God , and you yourselves thrust out .
And they shall come from the east , and from the west , and from the north , and from the south , and shall sit down in the kingdom of God .
And , behold , there are last which shall be first , and there are first which shall be last .
The same day there came certain of the Pharisees , saying unto him , Get thee out , and depart hence : for Herod will kill thee .
And he said unto them , Go ye , and tell that fox , Behold , I cast out devils , and I do cures to day and to morrow , and the third day I shall be perfected .
Nevertheless I must walk to day , and to morrow , and the day following : for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem .
O Jerusalem , Jerusalem , which killest the prophets , and stonest them that are sent unto thee ; how often would I have gathered thy children together , as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings , and ye would not !
Behold , your house is left unto you desolate : and verily I say unto you , Ye shall not see me , until the time come when ye shall say , Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord .
And it came to pass , as he went into the house of one of the chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day , that they watched him .
And , behold , there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy .
And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees , saying , Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day ?
And they held their peace . And he took him , and healed him , and let him go ;
And answered them , saying , Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit , and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day ?
And they could not answer him again to these things .
And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden , when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms ; saying unto them .
When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding , sit not down in the highest room ; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him ;
And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee , Give this man place ; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room .
But when thou art bidden , go and sit down in the lowest room ; that when he that bade thee cometh , he may say unto thee , Friend , go up higher : then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee .
For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
Then said he also to him that bade him , When thou makest a dinner or a supper , call not thy friends , nor thy brethren , neither thy kinsmen , nor thy rich neighbours ; lest they also bid thee again , and a recompence be made thee .
But when thou makest a feast , call the poor , the maimed , the lame , the blind :
And thou shalt be blessed ; for they cannot recompense thee : for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just .
And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things , he said unto him , Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God .
Then said he unto him , A certain man made a great supper , and bade many :
And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden , Come ; for all things are now ready .
And they all with one consent began to make excuse . The first said unto him , I have bought a piece of ground , and I must needs go and see it : I pray thee have me excused .
And another said , I have bought five yoke of oxen , and I go to prove them : I pray thee have me excused .
And another said , I have married a wife , and therefore I cannot come .
So that servant came , and shewed his lord these things . Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant , Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city , and bring in hither the poor , and the maimed , and the halt , and the blind .
And the servant said , Lord , it is done as thou hast commanded , and yet there is room .
And the lord said unto the servant , Go out into the highways and hedges , and compel them to come in , that my house may be filled .
For I say unto you , That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper .
And there went great multitudes with him : and he turned , and said unto them ,
If any man come to me , and hate not his father , and mother , and wife , and children , and brethren , and sisters , yea , and his own life also , he cannot be my disciple .
And whosoever doth not bear his cross , and come after me , cannot be my disciple .
For which of you , intending to build a tower , sitteth not down first , and counteth the cost , whether he have sufficient to finish it ?
Lest haply , after he hath laid the foundation , and is not able to finish it , all that behold it begin to mock him ,
Saying , This man began to build , and was not able to finish .
Or what king , going to make war against another king , sitteth not down first , and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand ?
Or else , while the other is yet a great way off , he sendeth an ambassage , and desireth conditions of peace .
So likewise , whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath , he cannot be my disciple .
Salt is good : but if the salt have lost his savour , wherewith shall it be seasoned ?
It is neither fit for the land , nor yet for the dunghill ; but men cast it out . He that hath ears to hear , let him hear .
Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him .
And the Pharisees and scribes murmured , saying , This man receiveth sinners , and eateth with them .
And he spake this parable unto them , saying ,
What man of you , having an hundred sheep , if he lose one of them , doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness , and go after that which is lost , until he find it ?
And when he hath found it , he layeth it on his shoulders , rejoicing .
And when he cometh home , he calleth together his friends and neighbours , saying unto them , Rejoice with me ; for I have found my sheep which was lost .
I say unto you , that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , more than over ninety and nine just persons , which need no repentance .
Either what woman having ten pieces of silver , if she lose one piece , doth not light a candle , and sweep the house , and seek diligently till she find it ?
And when she hath found it , she calleth her friends and her neighbours together , saying , Rejoice with me ; for I have found the piece which I had lost .
Likewise , I say unto you , there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth .
And he said , A certain man had two sons :
And the younger of them said to his father , Father , give me the portion of goods that falleth to me . And he divided unto them his living .
And not many days after the younger son gathered all together , and took his journey into a far country , and there wasted his substance with riotous living .
And when he had spent all , there arose a mighty famine in that land ; and he began to be in want .
And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country ; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine .
And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat : and no man gave unto him .
And when he came to himself , he said , How many hired servants of my father ' s have bread enough and to spare , and I perish with hunger !
I will arise and go to my father , and will say unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and before thee ,
And am no more worthy to be called thy son : make me as one of thy hired servants .
And he arose , and came to his father . But when he was yet a great way off , his father saw him , and had compassion , and ran , and fell on his neck , and kissed him .
And the son said unto him , Father , I have sinned against heaven , and in thy sight , and am no more worthy to be called thy son .
But the father said to his servants , Bring forth the best robe , and put it on him ; and put a ring on his hand , and shoes on his feet :
And bring hither the fatted calf , and kill it ; and let us eat , and be merry :
For this my son was dead , and is alive again ; he was lost , and is found . And they began to be merry .
Now his elder son was in the field : and as he came and drew nigh to the house , he heard musick and dancing .
And he called one of the servants , and asked what these things meant .
And he said unto him , Thy brother is come ; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf , because he hath received him safe and sound .
And he was angry , and would not go in : therefore came his father out , and intreated him .
And he answering said to his father , Lo , these many years do I serve thee , neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment : and yet thou never gavest me a kid , that I might make merry with my friends :
But as soon as this thy son was come , which hath devoured thy living with harlots , thou hast killed for him the fatted calf .
And he said unto him , Son , thou art ever with me , and all that I have is thine .
It was meet that we should make merry , and be glad : for this thy brother was dead , and is alive again ; and was lost , and is found .
And he said also unto his disciples , There was a certain rich man , which had a steward ; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods .
And he called him , and said unto him , How is it that I hear this of thee ? give an account of thy stewardship ; for thou mayest be no longer steward .
Then the steward said within himself , What shall I do ? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship : I cannot dig ; to beg I am ashamed .
I am resolved what to do , that , when I am put out of the stewardship , they may receive me into their houses .
So he called every one of his lord ' s debtors unto him , and said unto the first , How much owest thou unto my lord ?
And he said , An hundred measures of oil . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and sit down quickly , and write fifty .
Then said he to another , And how much owest thou ? And he said , An hundred measures of wheat . And he said unto him , Take thy bill , and write fourscore .
And the lord commended the unjust steward , because he had done wisely : for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light .
And I say unto you , Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness ; that , when ye fail , they may receive you into everlasting habitations .
He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much : and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much .
If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon , who will commit to your trust the true riches ?
And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man ' s , who shall give you that which is your own ?
No servant can serve two masters : for either he will hate the one , and love the other ; or else he will hold to the one , and despise the other . Ye cannot serve God and mammon .
And the Pharisees also , who were covetous , heard all these things : and they derided him .
And he said unto them , Ye are they which justify yourselves before men ; but God knoweth your hearts : for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God .
The law and the prophets were until John : since that time the kingdom of God is preached , and every man presseth into it .
And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass , than one tittle of the law to fail .
Whosoever putteth away his wife , and marrieth another , committeth adultery : and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery .
There was a certain rich man , which was clothed in purple and fine linen , and fared sumptuously every day :
And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus , which was laid at his gate , full of sores ,
And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man ' s table : moreover the dogs came and licked his sores .
And it came to pass , that the beggar died , and was carried by the angels into Abraham ' s bosom : the rich man also died , and was buried ;
And in hell he lift up his eyes , being in torments , and seeth Abraham afar off , and Lazarus in his bosom .
And he cried and said , Father Abraham , have mercy on me , and send Lazarus , that he may dip the tip of his finger in water , and cool my tongue ; for I am tormented in this flame .
But Abraham said , Son , remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things , and likewise Lazarus evil things : but now he is comforted , and thou art tormented .
And beside all this , between us and you there is a great gulf fixed : so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot ; neither can they pass to us , that would come from thence .
Then he said , I pray thee therefore , father , that thou wouldest send him to my father ' s house :
For I have five brethren ; that he may testify unto them , lest they also come into this place of torment .
Abraham saith unto him , They have Moses and the prophets ; let them hear them .
And he said , Nay , father Abraham : but if one went unto them from the dead , they will repent .
And he said unto him , If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded , though one rose from the dead .
Then said he unto the disciples , It is impossible but that offences will come : but woe unto him , through whom they come !
It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck , and he cast into the sea , than that he should offend one of these little ones .
Take heed to yourselves : If thy brother trespass against thee , rebuke him ; and if he repent , forgive him .
And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day , and seven times in a day turn again to thee , saying , I repent ; thou shalt forgive him .
And the apostles said unto the Lord , Increase our faith .
And the Lord said , If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed , ye might say unto this sycamine tree , Be thou plucked up by the root , and be thou planted in the sea ; and it should obey you .
But which of you , having a servant plowing or feeding cattle , will say unto him by and by , when he is come from the field , Go and sit down to meat ?
And will not rather say unto him , Make ready wherewith I may sup , and gird thyself , and serve me , till I have eaten and drunken ; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink ?
Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him ? I trow not .
So likewise ye , when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you , say , We are unprofitable servants : we have done that which was our duty to do .
And it came to pass , as he went to Jerusalem , that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee .
And as he entered into a certain village , there met him ten men that were lepers , which stood afar off :
And they lifted up their voices , and said , Jesus , Master , have mercy on us .
And when he saw them , he said unto them , Go shew yourselves unto the priests . And it came to pass , that , as they went , they were cleansed .
And one of them , when he saw that he was healed , turned back , and with a loud voice glorified God ,
And fell down on his face at his feet , giving him thanks : and he was a Samaritan .
And Jesus answering said , Were there not ten cleansed ? but where are the nine ?
There are not found that returned to give glory to God , save this stranger .
And he said unto him , Arise , go thy way : thy faith hath made thee whole .
And when he was demanded of the Pharisees , when the kingdom of God should come , he answered them and said , The kingdom of God cometh not with observation :
Neither shall they say , Lo here ! or , lo there ! for , behold , the kingdom of God is within you .
And he said unto the disciples , The days will come , when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man , and ye shall not see it .
And they shall say to you , See here ; or , see there : go not after them , nor follow them .
For as the lightning , that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven , shineth unto the other part under heaven ; so shall also the Son of man be in his day .
But first must he suffer many things , and be rejected of this generation .
And as it was in the days of Noe , so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man .
They did eat , they drank , they married wives , they were given in marriage , until the day that Noe entered into the ark , and the flood came , and destroyed them all .
Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot ; they did eat , they drank , they bought , they sold , they planted , they builded ;
But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven , and destroyed them all .
Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed .
In that day , he which shall be upon the housetop , and his stuff in the house , let him not come down to take it away : and he that is in the field , let him likewise not return back .
Remember Lot ' s wife .
Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it ; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it .
I tell you , in that night there shall be two men in one bed ; the one shall be taken , and the other shall be left .
Two women shall be grinding together ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
Two men shall be in the field ; the one shall be taken , and the other left .
And they answered and said unto him , Where , Lord ? And he said unto them , Wheresoever the body is , thither will the eagles be gathered together .
And he spake a parable unto them to this end , that men ought always to pray , and not to faint ;
Saying , There was in a city a judge , which feared not God , neither regarded man :
And there was a widow in that city ; and she came unto him , saying , Avenge me of mine adversary .
And he would not for a while : but afterward he said within himself , Though I fear not God , nor regard man ;
Yet because this widow troubleth me , I will avenge her , lest by her continual coming she weary me .
And the Lord said , Hear what the unjust judge saith .
And shall not God avenge his own elect , which cry day and night unto him , though he bear long with them ?
I tell you that he will avenge them speedily . Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh , shall he find faith on the earth ?
And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous , and despised others :
Two men went up into the temple to pray ; the one a Pharisee , and the other a publican .
The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself , God , I thank thee , that I am not as other men are , extortioners , unjust , adulterers , or even as this publican .
I fast twice in the week , I give tithes of all that I possess .
And the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , God be merciful to me a sinner .
I tell you , this man went down to his house justified rather than the other : for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased ; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted .
And they brought unto him also infants , that he would touch them : but when his disciples saw it , they rebuked them .
But Jesus called them unto him , and said , Suffer little children to come unto me , and forbid them not : for of such is the kingdom of God .
Verily I say unto you , Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein .
And a certain ruler asked him , saying , Good Master , what shall I do to inherit eternal life ?
And Jesus said unto him , Why callest thou me good ? none is good , save one , that is , God .
Thou knowest the commandments , Do not commit adultery , Do not kill , Do not steal , Do not bear false witness , Honour thy father and thy mother .
And he said , All these have I kept from my youth up .
Now when Jesus heard these things , he said unto him , Yet lackest thou one thing : sell all that thou hast , and distribute unto the poor , and thou shalt have treasure in heaven : and come , follow me .
And when he heard this , he was very sorrowful : for he was very rich .
And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful , he said , How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God !
For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle ' s eye , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God .
And they that heard it said , Who then can be saved ?
And he said , The things which are impossible with men are possible with God .
Then Peter said , Lo , we have left all , and followed thee .
And he said unto them , Verily I say unto you , There is no man that hath left house , or parents , or brethren , or wife , or children , for the kingdom of God ' s sake ,
Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time , and in the world to come life everlasting .
Then he took unto him the twelve , and said unto them , Behold , we go up to Jerusalem , and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished .
For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles , and shall be mocked , and spitefully entreated , and spitted on :
And they shall scourge him , and put him to death : and the third day he shall rise again .
And they understood none of these things : and this saying was hid from them , neither knew they the things which were spoken .
And it came to pass , that as he was come nigh unto Jericho , a certain blind man sat by the way side begging :
And hearing the multitude pass by , he asked what it meant .
And they told him , that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by .
And he cried , saying , Jesus , thou son of David , have mercy on me .
And they which went before rebuked him , that he should hold his peace : but he cried so much the more , Thou son of David , have mercy on me .
And Jesus stood , and commanded him to be brought unto him : and when he was come near , he asked him ,
Saying , What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee ? And he said , Lord , that I may receive my sight .
And Jesus said unto him , Receive thy sight : thy faith hath saved thee .
And immediately he received his sight , and followed him , glorifying God : and all the people , when they saw it , gave praise unto God .
And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho .
And , behold , there was a man named Zacchaeus , which was the chief among the publicans , and he was rich .
And he sought to see Jesus who he was ; and could not for the press , because he was little of stature .
And he ran before , and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him : for he was to pass that way .
And when Jesus came to the place , he looked up , and saw him , and said unto him , Zacchaeus , make haste , and come down ; for to day I must abide at thy house .
And he made haste , and came down , and received him joyfully .
And when they saw it , they all murmured , saying , That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner .
And Zacchaeus stood , and said unto the Lord : Behold , Lord , the half of my goods I give to the poor ; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation , I restore him fourfold .
And Jesus said unto him , This day is salvation come to this house , forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham .
For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost .
And as they heard these things , he added and spake a parable , because he was nigh to Jerusalem , and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear .
He said therefore , A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom , and to return .
And he called his ten servants , and delivered them ten pounds , and said unto them , Occupy till I come .
But his citizens hated him , and sent a message after him , saying , We will not have this man to reign over us .
And it came to pass , that when he was returned , having received the kingdom , then he commanded these servants to be called unto him , to whom he had given the money , that he might know how much every man had gained by trading .
Then came the first , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained ten pounds .
And he said unto him , Well , thou good servant : because thou hast been faithful in a very little , have thou authority over ten cities .
And the second came , saying , Lord , thy pound hath gained five pounds .
And he said likewise to him , Be thou also over five cities .
And another came , saying , Lord , behold , here is thy pound , which I have kept laid up in a napkin :
For I feared thee , because thou art an austere man : thou takest up that thou layedst not down , and reapest that thou didst not sow .
And he saith unto him , Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee , thou wicked servant . Thou knewest that I was an austere man , taking up that I laid not down , and reaping that I did not sow :
Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank , that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury ?
And he said unto them that stood by , Take from him the pound , and give it to him that hath ten pounds .
( And they said unto him , Lord , he hath ten pounds . )
For I say unto you , That unto every one which hath shall be given ; and from him that hath not , even that he hath shall be taken away from him .
But those mine enemies , which would not that I should reign over them , bring hither , and slay them before me .
And when he had thus spoken , he went before , ascending up to Jerusalem .
And it came to pass , when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany , at the mount called the mount of Olives , he sent two of his disciples ,
Saying , Go ye into the village over against you ; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied , whereon yet never man sat : loose him , and bring him hither .
And if any man ask you , Why do ye loose him ? thus shall ye say unto him , Because the Lord hath need of him .
And they that were sent went their way , and found even as he had said unto them .
And as they were loosing the colt , the owners thereof said unto them , Why loose ye the colt ?
And they said , The Lord hath need of him .
And they brought him to Jesus : and they cast their garments upon the colt , and they set Jesus thereon .
And as he went , they spread their clothes in the way .
And when he was come nigh , even now at the descent of the mount of Olives , the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen ;
Saying , Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord : peace in heaven , and glory in the highest .
And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him , Master , rebuke thy disciples .
And he answered and said unto them , I tell you that , if these should hold their peace , the stones would immediately cry out .
And when he was come near , he beheld the city , and wept over it ,
Saying , If thou hadst known , even thou , at least in this thy day , the things which belong unto thy peace ! but now they are hid from thine eyes .
For the days shall come upon thee , that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee , and compass thee round , and keep thee in on every side ,
And shall lay thee even with the ground , and thy children within thee ; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another ; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation .
And he went into the temple , and began to cast out them that sold therein , and them that bought ;
Saying unto them , It is written , My house is the house of prayer : but ye have made it a den of thieves .
And he taught daily in the temple . But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him ,
And could not find what they might do : for all the people were very attentive to hear him .
And it came to pass , that on one of those days , as he taught the people in the temple , and preached the gospel , the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders ,
And spake unto him , saying , Tell us , by what authority doest thou these things ? or who is he that gave thee this authority ?
And he answered and said unto them , I will also ask you one thing ; and answer me :
The baptism of John , was it from heaven , or of men ?
And they reasoned with themselves , saying , If we shall say , From heaven ; he will say , Why then believed ye him not ?
But and if we say , Of men ; all the people will stone us : for they be persuaded that John was a prophet .
And they answered , that they could not tell whence it was .
And Jesus said unto them , Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things .
Then began he to speak to the people this parable ; A certain man planted a vineyard , and let it forth to husbandmen , and went into a far country for a long time .
And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen , that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard : but the husbandmen beat him , and sent him away empty .
And again he sent another servant : and they beat him also , and entreated him shamefully , and sent him away empty .
And again he sent a third : and they wounded him also , and cast him out .
Then said the lord of the vineyard , What shall I do ? I will send my beloved son : it may be they will reverence him when they see him .
But when the husbandmen saw him , they reasoned among themselves , saying , This is the heir : come , let us kill him , that the inheritance may be ours .
So they cast him out of the vineyard , and killed him . What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them ?
He shall come and destroy these husbandmen , and shall give the vineyard to others . And when they heard it , they said , God forbid .
And he beheld them , and said , What is this then that is written , The stone which the builders rejected , the same is become the head of the corner ?
Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken ; but on whomsoever it shall fall , it will grind him to powder .
And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him ; and they feared the people : for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them .
And they watched him , and sent forth spies , which should feign themselves just men , that they might take hold of his words , that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor .
And they asked him , saying , Master , we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly , neither acceptest thou the person of any , but teachest the way of God truly :
Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar , or no ?
But he perceived their craftiness , and said unto them , Why tempt ye me ?
Shew me a penny . Whose image and superscription hath it ? They answered and said , Caesar ' s .
And he said unto them , Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar ' s , and unto God the things which be God ' s .
And they could not take hold of his words before the people : and they marvelled at his answer , and held their peace .
Then came to him certain of the Sadducees , which deny that there is any resurrection ; and they asked him ,
Saying , Master , Moses wrote unto us , If any man ' s brother die , having a wife , and he die without children , that his brother should take his wife , and raise up seed unto his brother .
There were therefore seven brethren : and the first took a wife , and died without children .
And the second took her to wife , and he died childless .
And the third took her ; and in like manner the seven also : and they left no children , and died .
Last of all the woman died also .
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she ? for seven had her to wife .
And Jesus answering said unto them , The children of this world marry , and are given in marriage :
But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are given in marriage :
Neither can they die any more : for they are equal unto the angels ; and are the children of God , being the children of the resurrection .
Now that the dead are raised , even Moses shewed at the bush , when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob .
For he is not a God of the dead , but of the living : for all live unto him .
Then certain of the scribes answering said , Master , thou hast well said .
And after that they durst not ask him any question at all .
And he said unto them , How say they that Christ is David ' s son ?
And David himself saith in the book of Psalms , The LORD said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
Till I make thine enemies thy footstool .
David therefore calleth him Lord , how is he then his son ?
Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples ,
Beware of the scribes , which desire to walk in long robes , and love greetings in the markets , and the highest seats in the synagogues , and the chief rooms at feasts ;
Which devour widows ' houses , and for a shew make long prayers : the same shall receive greater damnation .
And he looked up , and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury .
And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites .
And he said , Of a truth I say unto you , that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all :
For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God : but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had .
And as some spake of the temple , how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts , he said ,
As for these things which ye behold , the days will come , in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another , that shall not be thrown down .
And they asked him , saying , Master , but when shall these things be ? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ?
And he said , Take heed that ye be not deceived : for many shall come in my name , saying , I am Christ ; and the time draweth near : go ye not therefore after them .
But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions , be not terrified : for these things must first come to pass ; but the end is not by and by .
Then said he unto them , Nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom :
And great earthquakes shall be in divers places , and famines , and pestilences ; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven .
But before all these , they shall lay their hands on you , and persecute you , delivering you up to the synagogues , and into prisons , being brought before kings and rulers for my name ' s sake .
And it shall turn to you for a testimony .
Settle it therefore in your hearts , not to meditate before what ye shall answer :
For I will give you a mouth and wisdom , which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist .
And ye shall be betrayed both by parents , and brethren , and kinsfolks , and friends ; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death .
And ye shall be hated of all men for my name ' s sake .
But there shall not an hair of your head perish .
In your patience possess ye your souls .
And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies , then know that the desolation thereof is nigh .
Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains ; and let them which are in the midst of it depart out ; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto .
For these be the days of vengeance , that all things which are written may be fulfilled .
But woe unto them that are with child , and to them that give suck , in those days ! for there shall be great distress in the land , and wrath upon this people .
And they shall fall by the edge of the sword , and shall be led away captive into all nations : and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles , until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled .
And there shall be signs in the sun , and in the moon , and in the stars ; and upon the earth distress of nations , with perplexity ; the sea and the waves roaring ;
Men ' s hearts failing them for fear , and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth : for the powers of heaven shall be shaken .
And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
And when these things begin to come to pass , then look up , and lift up your heads ; for your redemption draweth nigh .
And he spake to them a parable ; Behold the fig tree , and all the trees ;
When they now shoot forth , ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand .
So likewise ye , when ye see these things come to pass , know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand .
Verily I say unto you , This generation shall not pass away , till all be fulfilled .
Heaven and earth shall pass away : but my words shall not pass away .
And take heed to yourselves , lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting , and drunkenness , and cares of this life , and so that day come upon you unawares .
For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth .
Watch ye therefore , and pray always , that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass , and to stand before the Son of man .
And in the day time he was teaching in the temple ; and at night he went out , and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives .
And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple , for to hear him .
Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh , which is called the Passover .
And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him ; for they feared the people .
Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot , being of the number of the twelve .
And he went his way , and communed with the chief priests and captains , how he might betray him unto them .
And they were glad , and covenanted to give him money .
And he promised , and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude .
Then came the day of unleavened bread , when the passover must be killed .
And he sent Peter and John , saying , Go and prepare us the passover , that we may eat .
And they said unto him , Where wilt thou that we prepare ?
And he said unto them , Behold , when ye are entered into the city , there shall a man meet you , bearing a pitcher of water ; follow him into the house where he entereth in .
And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house , The Master saith unto thee , Where is the guestchamber , where I shall eat the passover with my disciples ?
And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished : there make ready .
And they went , and found as he had said unto them : and they made ready the passover .
And when the hour was come , he sat down , and the twelve apostles with him .
And he said unto them , With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer :
For I say unto you , I will not any more eat thereof , until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God .
And he took the cup , and gave thanks , and said , Take this , and divide it among yourselves :
For I say unto you , I will not drink of the fruit of the vine , until the kingdom of God shall come .
And he took bread , and gave thanks , and brake it , and gave unto them , saying , This is my body which is given for you : this do in remembrance of me .
Likewise also the cup after supper , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood , which is shed for you .
But , behold , the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table .
And truly the Son of man goeth , as it was determined : but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed !
And they began to enquire among themselves , which of them it was that should do this thing .
And there was also a strife among them , which of them should be accounted the greatest .
And he said unto them , The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them ; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors .
But ye shall not be so : but he that is greatest among you , let him be as the younger ; and he that is chief , as he that doth serve .
For whether is greater , he that sitteth at meat , or he that serveth ? is not he that sitteth at meat ? but I am among you as he that serveth .
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations .
And I appoint unto you a kingdom , as my Father hath appointed unto me ;
That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom , and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel .
And the Lord said , Simon , Simon , behold , Satan hath desired to have you , that he may sift you as wheat :
But I have prayed for thee , that thy faith fail not : and when thou art converted , strengthen thy brethren .
And he said unto him , Lord , I am ready to go with thee , both into prison , and to death .
And he said , I tell thee , Peter , the cock shall not crow this day , before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me .
And he said unto them , When I sent you without purse , and scrip , and shoes , lacked ye any thing ? And they said , Nothing .
Then said he unto them , But now , he that hath a purse , let him take it , and likewise his scrip : and he that hath no sword , let him sell his garment , and buy one .
For I say unto you , that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me , And he was reckoned among the transgressors : for the things concerning me have an end .
And they said , Lord , behold , here are two swords . And he said unto them , It is enough .
And he came out , and went , as he was wont , to the mount of Olives ; and his disciples also followed him .
And when he was at the place , he said unto them , Pray that ye enter not into temptation .
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone ' s cast , and kneeled down , and prayed ,
Saying , Father , if thou be willing , remove this cup from me : nevertheless not my will , but thine , be done .
And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven , strengthening him .
And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly : and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground .
And when he rose up from prayer , and was come to his disciples , he found them sleeping for sorrow ,
And said unto them , Why sleep ye ? rise and pray , lest ye enter into temptation .
And while he yet spake , behold a multitude , and he that was called Judas , one of the twelve , went before them , and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him .
But Jesus said unto him , Judas , betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss ?
When they which were about him saw what would follow , they said unto him , Lord , shall we smite with the sword ?
And one of them smote the servant of the high priest , and cut off his right ear .
And Jesus answered and said , Suffer ye thus far . And he touched his ear , and healed him .
Then Jesus said unto the chief priests , and captains of the temple , and the elders , which were come to him , Be ye come out , as against a thief , with swords and staves ?
When I was daily with you in the temple , ye stretched forth no hands against me : but this is your hour , and the power of darkness .
Then took they him , and led him , and brought him into the high priest ' s house . And Peter followed afar off .
And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall , and were set down together , Peter sat down among them .
But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire , and earnestly looked upon him , and said , This man was also with him .
And he denied him , saying , Woman , I know him not .
And after a little while another saw him , and said , Thou art also of them . And Peter said , Man , I am not .
And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed , saying , Of a truth this fellow also was with him : for he is a Galilaean .
And Peter said , Man , I know not what thou sayest . And immediately , while he yet spake , the cock crew .
And the Lord turned , and looked upon Peter . And Peter remembered the word of the Lord , how he had said unto him , Before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .
And Peter went out , and wept bitterly .
And the men that held Jesus mocked him , and smote him .
And when they had blindfolded him , they struck him on the face , and asked him , saying , Prophesy , who is it that smote thee ?
And many other things blasphemously spake they against him .
And as soon as it was day , the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together , and led him into their council , saying ,
Art thou the Christ ? tell us . And he said unto them , If I tell you , ye will not believe :
And if I also ask you , ye will not answer me , nor let me go .
Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God .
Then said they all , Art thou then the Son of God ? And he said unto them , Ye say that I am .
And they said , What need we any further witness ? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth .
And the whole multitude of them arose , and led him unto Pilate .
And they began to accuse him , saying , We found this fellow perverting the nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , saying that he himself is Christ a King .
And Pilate asked him , saying , Art thou the King of the Jews ? And he answered him and said , Thou sayest it .
Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people , I find no fault in this man .
And they were the more fierce , saying , He stirreth up the people , teaching throughout all Jewry , beginning from Galilee to this place .
When Pilate heard of Galilee , he asked whether the man were a Galilaean .
And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod ' s jurisdiction , he sent him to Herod , who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time .
And when Herod saw Jesus , he was exceeding glad : for he was desirous to see him of a long season , because he had heard many things of him ; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him .
Then he questioned with him in many words ; but he answered him nothing .
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him .
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought , and mocked him , and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe , and sent him again to Pilate .
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together : for before they were at enmity between themselves .
And Pilate , when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people ,
Said unto them , Ye have brought this man unto me , as one that perverteth the people : and , behold , I , having examined him before you , have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him :
No , nor yet Herod : for I sent you to him ; and , lo , nothing worthy of death is done unto him .
I will therefore chastise him , and release him .
( For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast . )
And they cried out all at once , saying , Away with this man , and release unto us Barabbas :
( Who for a certain sedition made in the city , and for murder , was cast into prison . )
Pilate therefore , willing to release Jesus , spake again to them .
But they cried , saying , Crucify him , crucify him .
And he said unto them the third time , Why , what evil hath he done ? I have found no cause of death in him : I will therefore chastise him , and let him go .
And they were instant with loud voices , requiring that he might be crucified . And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed .
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required .
And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison , whom they had desired ; but he delivered Jesus to their will .
And as they led him away , they laid hold upon one Simon , a Cyrenian , coming out of the country , and on him they laid the cross , that he might bear it after Jesus .
And there followed him a great company of people , and of women , which also bewailed and lamented him .
But Jesus turning unto them said , Daughters of Jerusalem , weep not for me , but weep for yourselves , and for your children .
For , behold , the days are coming , in the which they shall say , Blessed are the barren , and the wombs that never bare , and the paps which never gave suck .
Then shall they begin to say to the mountains , Fall on us ; and to the hills , Cover us .
For if they do these things in a green tree , what shall be done in the dry ?
And there were also two other , malefactors , led with him to be put to death .
And when they were come to the place , which is called Calvary , there they crucified him , and the malefactors , one on the right hand , and the other on the left .
Then said Jesus , Father , forgive them ; for they know not what they do . And they parted his raiment , and cast lots .
And the people stood beholding . And the rulers also with them derided him , saying , He saved others ; let him save himself , if he be Christ , the chosen of God .
And the soldiers also mocked him , coming to him , and offering him vinegar ,
And saying , If thou be the king of the Jews , save thyself .
And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek , and Latin , and Hebrew , THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS .
And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him , saying , If thou be Christ , save thyself and us .
But the other answering rebuked him , saying , Dost not thou fear God , seeing thou art in the same condemnation ?
And we indeed justly ; for we receive the due reward of our deeds : but this man hath done nothing amiss .
And he said unto Jesus , Lord , remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom .
And Jesus said unto him , Verily I say unto thee , To day shalt thou be with me in paradise .
And it was about the sixth hour , and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour .
And the sun was darkened , and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst .
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , Father , into thy hands I commend my spirit : and having said thus , he gave up the ghost .
Now when the centurion saw what was done , he glorified God , saying , Certainly this was a righteous man .
And all the people that came together to that sight , beholding the things which were done , smote their breasts , and returned .
And all his acquaintance , and the women that followed him from Galilee , stood afar off , beholding these things .
And , behold , there was a man named Joseph , a counsellor ; and he was a good man , and a just :
( The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them ; ) he was of Arimathaea , a city of the Jews : who also himself waited for the kingdom of God .
This man went unto Pilate , and begged the body of Jesus .
And he took it down , and wrapped it in linen , and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone , wherein never man before was laid .
And that day was the preparation , and the sabbath drew on .
And the women also , which came with him from Galilee , followed after , and beheld the sepulchre , and how his body was laid .
And they returned , and prepared spices and ointments ; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment .
In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
The same was in the beginning with God .
All things were made by him ; and without him was not any thing made that was made .
In him was life ; and the life was the light of men .
And the light shineth in darkness ; and the darkness comprehended it not .
There was a man sent from God , whose name was John .
The same came for a witness , to bear witness of the Light , that all men through him might believe .
He was not that Light , but was sent to bear witness of that Light .
That was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world .
He was in the world , and the world was made by him , and the world knew him not .
He came unto his own , and his own received him not .
But as many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God , even to them that believe on his name :
Which were born , not of blood , nor of the will of the flesh , nor of the will of man , but of God .
And the Word was made flesh , and dwelt among us , ( and we beheld his glory , the glory as of the only begotten of the Father , ) full of grace and truth .
John bare witness of him , and cried , saying , This was he of whom I spake , He that cometh after me is preferred before me : for he was before me .
And of his fulness have all we received , and grace for grace .
For the law was given by Moses , but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ .
No man hath seen God at any time , the only begotten Son , which is in the bosom of the Father , he hath declared him .
And this is the record of John , when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him , Who art thou ?
And he confessed , and denied not ; but confessed , I am not the Christ .
And they asked him , What then ? Art thou Elias ? And he saith , I am not . Art thou that prophet ? And he answered , No .
Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? that we may give an answer to them that sent us . What sayest thou of thyself ?
He said , I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness , Make straight the way of the Lord , as said the prophet Esaias .
And they which were sent were of the Pharisees .
And they asked him , and said unto him , Why baptizest thou then , if thou be not that Christ , nor Elias , neither that prophet ?
John answered them , saying , I baptize with water : but there standeth one among you , whom ye know not ;
He it is , who coming after me is preferred before me , whose shoe ' s latchet I am not worthy to unloose .
These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan , where John was baptizing .
The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him , and saith , Behold the Lamb of God , which taketh away the sin of the world .
This is he of whom I said , After me cometh a man which is preferred before me : for he was before me .
And I knew him not : but that he should be made manifest to Israel , therefore am I come baptizing with water .
And John bare record , saying , I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove , and it abode upon him .
And I knew him not : but he that sent me to baptize with water , the same said unto me , Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending , and remaining on him , the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost .
And I saw , and bare record that this is the Son of God .
Again the next day after John stood , and two of his disciples ;
And looking upon Jesus as he walked , he saith , Behold the Lamb of God !
And the two disciples heard him speak , and they followed Jesus .
Then Jesus turned , and saw them following , and saith unto them , What seek ye ? They said unto him , Rabbi , ( which is to say , being interpreted , Master , ) where dwellest thou ?
He saith unto them , Come and see . They came and saw where he dwelt , and abode with him that day : for it was about the tenth hour .
One of the two which heard John speak , and followed him , was Andrew , Simon Peter ' s brother .
He first findeth his own brother Simon , and saith unto him , We have found the Messias , which is , being interpreted , the Christ .
And he brought him to Jesus . And when Jesus beheld him , he said , Thou art Simon the son of Jona : thou shalt be called Cephas , which is by interpretation , A stone .
The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee , and findeth Philip , and saith unto him , Follow me .
Now Philip was of Bethsaida , the city of Andrew and Peter .
Philip findeth Nathanael , and saith unto him , We have found him , of whom Moses in the law , and the prophets , did write , Jesus of Nazareth , the son of Joseph .
And Nathanael said unto him , Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth ? Philip saith unto him , Come and see .
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him , and saith of him , Behold an Israelite indeed , in whom is no guile !
Nathanael saith unto him , Whence knowest thou me ? Jesus answered and said unto him , Before that Philip called thee , when thou wast under the fig tree , I saw thee .
Nathanael answered and saith unto him , Rabbi , thou art the Son of God ; thou art the King of Israel .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Because I said unto thee , I saw thee under the fig tree , believest thou ? thou shalt see greater things than these .
And he saith unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Hereafter ye shall see heaven open , and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man .
And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee ; and the mother of Jesus was there :
And both Jesus was called , and his disciples , to the marriage .
And when they wanted wine , the mother of Jesus saith unto him , They have no wine .
Jesus saith unto her , Woman , what have I to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come .
His mother saith unto the servants , Whatsoever he saith unto you , do it .
And there were set there six waterpots of stone , after the manner of the purifying of the Jews , containing two or three firkins apiece .
Jesus saith unto them , Fill the waterpots with water . And they filled them up to the brim .
And he saith unto them , Draw out now , and bear unto the governor of the feast . And they bare it .
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine , and knew not whence it was : ( but the servants which drew the water knew ; ) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom ,
And saith unto him , Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine ; and when men have well drunk , then that which is worse : but thou hast kept the good wine until now .
This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee , and manifested forth his glory ; and his disciples believed on him .
After this he went down to Capernaum , he , and his mother , and his brethren , and his disciples : and they continued there not many days .
And the Jews ' passover was at hand , and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves , and the changers of money sitting :
And when he had made a scourge of small cords , he drove them all out of the temple , and the sheep , and the oxen ; and poured out the changers ' money , and overthrew the tables ;
And said unto them that sold doves , Take these things hence ; make not my Father ' s house an house of merchandise .
And his disciples remembered that it was written , The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up .
Then answered the Jews and said unto him , What sign shewest thou unto us , seeing that thou doest these things ?
Jesus answered and said unto them , Destroy this temple , and in three days I will raise it up .
Then said the Jews , Forty and six years was this temple in building , and wilt thou rear it up in three days ?
But he spake of the temple of his body .
When therefore he was risen from the dead , his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them ; and they believed the scripture , and the word which Jesus had said .
Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover , in the feast day , many believed in his name , when they saw the miracles which he did .
But Jesus did not commit himself unto them , because he knew all men ,
And needed not that any should testify of man : for he knew what was in man .
There was a man of the Pharisees , named Nicodemus , a ruler of the Jews :
The same came to Jesus by night , and said unto him , Rabbi , we know that thou art a teacher come from God : for no man can do these miracles that thou doest , except God be with him .
Jesus answered and said unto him , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God .
Nicodemus saith unto him , How can a man be born when he is old ? can he enter the second time into his mother ' s womb , and be born ?
Jesus answered , Verily , verily , I say unto thee , Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of God .
That which is born of the flesh is flesh ; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
Marvel not that I said unto thee , Ye must be born again .
The wind bloweth where it listeth , and thou hearest the sound thereof , but canst not tell whence it cometh , and whither it goeth : so is every one that is born of the Spirit .
Nicodemus answered and said unto him , How can these things be ?
Jesus answered and said unto him , Art thou a master of Israel , and knowest not these things ?
Verily , verily , I say unto thee , We speak that we do know , and testify that we have seen ; and ye receive not our witness .
If I have told you earthly things , and ye believe not , how shall ye believe , if I tell you of heavenly things ?
And no man hath ascended up to heaven , but he that came down from heaven , even the Son of man which is in heaven .
And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness , even so must the Son of man be lifted up :
That whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have eternal life .
For God so loved the world , that he gave his only begotten Son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish , but have everlasting life .
For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world ; but that the world through him might be saved .
He that believeth on him is not condemned : but he that believeth not is condemned already , because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God .
And this is the condemnation , that light is come into the world , and men loved darkness rather than light , because their deeds were evil .
For every one that doeth evil hateth the light , neither cometh to the light , lest his deeds should be reproved .
But he that doeth truth cometh to the light , that his deeds may be made manifest , that they are wrought in God .
After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea ; and there he tarried with them , and baptized .
And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim , because there was much water there : and they came , and were baptized .
For John was not yet cast into prison .
Then there arose a question between some of John ' s disciples and the Jews about purifying .
And they came unto John , and said unto him , Rabbi , he that was with thee beyond Jordan , to whom thou barest witness , behold , the same baptizeth , and all men come to him .
John answered and said , A man can receive nothing , except it be given him from heaven .
Ye yourselves bear me witness , that I said , I am not the Christ , but that I am sent before him .
He that hath the bride is the bridegroom : but the friend of the bridegroom , which standeth and heareth him , rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom ' s voice : this my joy therefore is fulfilled .
He must increase , but I must decrease .
He that cometh from above is above all : he that is of the earth is earthly , and speaketh of the earth : he that cometh from heaven is above all .
And what he hath seen and heard , that he testifieth ; and no man receiveth his testimony .
He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true .
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God : for God giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him .
The Father loveth the Son , and hath given all things into his hand .
He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life : and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life ; but the wrath of God abideth on him .
When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John ,
( Though Jesus himself baptized not , but his disciples , )
He left Judaea , and departed again into Galilee .
And he must needs go through Samaria .
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria , which is called Sychar , near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph .
Now Jacob ' s well was there . Jesus therefore , being wearied with his journey , sat thus on the well : and it was about the sixth hour .
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water : Jesus saith unto her , Give me to drink .
( For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat . )
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him , How is it that thou , being a Jew , askest drink of me , which am a woman of Samaria ? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans .
Jesus answered and said unto her , If thou knewest the gift of God , and who it is that saith to thee , Give me to drink ; thou wouldest have asked of him , and he would have given thee living water .
The woman saith unto him , Sir , thou hast nothing to draw with , and the well is deep : from whence then hast thou that living water ?
Art thou greater than our father Jacob , which gave us the well , and drank thereof himself , and his children , and his cattle ?
Jesus answered and said unto her , Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again :
But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst ; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life .
The woman saith unto him , Sir , give me this water , that I thirst not , neither come hither to draw .
Jesus saith unto her , Go , call thy husband , and come hither .
The woman answered and said , I have no husband . Jesus said unto her , Thou hast well said , I have no husband :
For thou hast had five husbands ; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband : in that saidst thou truly .
The woman saith unto him , Sir , I perceive that thou art a prophet .
Our fathers worshipped in this mountain ; and ye say , that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship .
Jesus saith unto her , Woman , believe me , the hour cometh , when ye shall neither in this mountain , nor yet at Jerusalem , worship the Father .
Ye worship ye know not what : we know what we worship : for salvation is of the Jews .
But the hour cometh , and now is , when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth : for the Father seeketh such to worship him .
God is a Spirit : and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth .
The woman saith unto him , I know that Messias cometh , which is called Christ : when he is come , he will tell us all things .
Jesus saith unto her , I that speak unto thee am he .
And upon this came his disciples , and marvelled that he talked with the woman : yet no man said , What seekest thou ? or , Why talkest thou with her ?
The woman then left her waterpot , and went her way into the city , and saith to the men ,
Come , see a man , which told me all things that ever I did : is not this the Christ ?
Then they went out of the city , and came unto him .
In the mean while his disciples prayed him , saying , Master , eat .
But he said unto them , I have meat to eat that ye know not of .
Therefore said the disciples one to another , Hath any man brought him ought to eat ?
Jesus saith unto them , My meat is to do the will of him that sent me , and to finish his work .
Say not ye , There are yet four months , and then cometh harvest ? behold , I say unto you , Lift up your eyes , and look on the fields ; for they are white already to harvest .
And he that reapeth receiveth wages , and gathereth fruit unto life eternal : that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together .
And herein is that saying true , One soweth , and another reapeth .
I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour : other men laboured , and ye are entered into their labours .
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman , which testified , He told me all that ever I did .
So when the Samaritans were come unto him , they besought him that he would tarry with them : and he abode there two days .
And many more believed because of his own word ;
And said unto the woman , Now we believe , not because of thy saying : for we have heard him ourselves , and know that this is indeed the Christ , the Saviour of the world .
Now after two days he departed thence , and went into Galilee .
For Jesus himself testified , that a prophet hath no honour in his own country .
Then when he was come into Galilee , the Galilaeans received him , having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast : for they also went unto the feast .
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee , where he made the water wine . And there was a certain nobleman , whose son was sick at Capernaum .
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee , he went unto him , and besought him that he would come down , and heal his son : for he was at the point of death .
Then said Jesus unto him , Except ye see signs and wonders , ye will not believe .
The nobleman saith unto him , Sir , come down ere my child die .
Jesus saith unto him , Go thy way ; thy son liveth . And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him , and he went his way .
And as he was now going down , his servants met him , and told him , saying , Thy son liveth .
Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend . And they said unto him , Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him .
So the father knew that it was at the same hour , in the which Jesus said unto him , Thy son liveth : and himself believed , and his whole house .
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did , when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee .
After this there was a feast of the Jews ; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem .
Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool , which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda , having five porches .
In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk , of blind , halt , withered , waiting for the moving of the water .
For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool , and troubled the water : whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had .
And a certain man was there , which had an infirmity thirty and eight years .
When Jesus saw him lie , and knew that he had been now a long time in that case , he saith unto him , Wilt thou be made whole ?
The impotent man answered him , Sir , I have no man , when the water is troubled , to put me into the pool : but while I am coming , another steppeth down before me .
Jesus saith unto him , Rise , take up thy bed , and walk .
And immediately the man was made whole , and took up his bed , and walked : and on the same day was the sabbath .
The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured , It is the sabbath day : it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed .
He answered them , He that made me whole , the same said unto me , Take up thy bed , and walk .
Then asked they him , What man is that which said unto thee , Take up thy bed , and walk ?
And he that was healed wist not who it was : for Jesus had conveyed himself away , a multitude being in that place .
Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple , and said unto him , Behold , thou art made whole : sin no more , lest a worse thing come unto thee .
The man departed , and told the Jews that it was Jesus , which had made him whole .
And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus , and sought to slay him , because he had done these things on the sabbath day .
But Jesus answered them , My Father worketh hitherto , and I work .
Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him , because he not only had broken the sabbath , but said also that God was his Father , making himself equal with God .
Then answered Jesus and said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , The Son can do nothing of himself , but what he seeth the Father do : for what things soever he doeth , these also doeth the Son likewise .
For the Father loveth the Son , and sheweth him all things that himself doeth : and he will shew him greater works than these , that ye may marvel .
For as the Father raiseth up the dead , and quickeneth them ; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will .
For the Father judgeth no man , but hath committed all judgment unto the Son :
That all men should honour the Son , even as they honour the Father . He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that heareth my word , and believeth on him that sent me , hath everlasting life , and shall not come into condemnation ; but is passed from death unto life .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The hour is coming , and now is , when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God : and they that hear shall live .
For as the Father hath life in himself ; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself ;
And hath given him authority to execute judgment also , because he is the Son of man .
Marvel not at this : for the hour is coming , in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice ,
And shall come forth ; they that have done good , unto the resurrection of life ; and they that have done evil , unto the resurrection of damnation .
I can of mine own self do nothing : as I hear , I judge : and my judgment is just ; because I seek not mine own will , but the will of the Father which hath sent me .
If I bear witness of myself , my witness is not true .
There is another that beareth witness of me ; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true .
Ye sent unto John , and he bare witness unto the truth .
But I receive not testimony from man : but these things I say , that ye might be saved .
He was a burning and a shining light : and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light .
But I have greater witness than that of John : for the works which the Father hath given me to finish , the same works that I do , bear witness of me , that the Father hath sent me .
And the Father himself , which hath sent me , hath borne witness of me . Ye have neither heard his voice at any time , nor seen his shape .
And ye have not his word abiding in you : for whom he hath sent , him ye believe not .
Search the scriptures ; for in them ye think ye have eternal life : and they are they which testify of me .
And ye will not come to me , that ye might have life .
I receive not honour from men .
But I know you , that ye have not the love of God in you .
I am come in my Father ' s name , and ye receive me not : if another shall come in his own name , him ye will receive .
How can ye believe , which receive honour one of another , and seek not the honour that cometh from God only ?
Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father : there is one that accuseth you , even Moses , in whom ye trust .
For had ye believed Moses , ye would have believed me ; for he wrote of me .
But if ye believe not his writings , how shall ye believe my words ?
After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee , which is the sea of Tiberias .
And a great multitude followed him , because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased .
And Jesus went up into a mountain , and there he sat with his disciples .
And the passover , a feast of the Jews , was nigh .
When Jesus then lifted up his eyes , and saw a great company come unto him , he saith unto Philip , Whence shall we buy bread , that these may eat ?
And this he said to prove him : for he himself knew what he would do .
Philip answered him , Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them , that every one of them may take a little .
One of his disciples , Andrew , Simon Peter ' s brother , saith unto him ,
There is a lad here , which hath five barley loaves , and two small fishes : but what are they among so many ?
And Jesus said , Make the men sit down . Now there was much grass in the place . So the men sat down , in number about five thousand .
And Jesus took the loaves ; and when he had given thanks , he distributed to the disciples , and the disciples to them that were set down ; and likewise of the fishes as much as they would .
When they were filled , he said unto his disciples , Gather up the fragments that remain , that nothing be lost .
Therefore they gathered them together , and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves , which remained over and above unto them that had eaten .
Then those men , when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did , said , This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world .
When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force , to make him a king , he departed again into a mountain himself alone .
And when even was now come , his disciples went down unto the sea ,
And entered into a ship , and went over the sea toward Capernaum . And it was now dark , and Jesus was not come to them .
And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew .
So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs , they see Jesus walking on the sea , and drawing nigh unto the ship : and they were afraid .
But he saith unto them , It is I ; be not afraid .
Then they willingly received him into the ship : and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went .
The day following , when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there , save that one whereinto his disciples were entered , and that Jesus went not with his disciples into the boat , but that his disciples were gone away alone ;
( Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread , after that the Lord had given thanks : )
When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there , neither his disciples , they also took shipping , and came to Capernaum , seeking for Jesus .
And when they had found him on the other side of the sea , they said unto him , Rabbi , when camest thou hither ?
Jesus answered them and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Ye seek me , not because ye saw the miracles , but because ye did eat of the loaves , and were filled .
Labour not for the meat which perisheth , but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life , which the Son of man shall give unto you : for him hath God the Father sealed .
Then said they unto him , What shall we do , that we might work the works of God ?
Jesus answered and said unto them , This is the work of God , that ye believe on him whom he hath sent .
They said therefore unto him , What sign shewest thou then , that we may see , and believe thee ? what dost thou work ?
Our fathers did eat manna in the desert ; as it is written , He gave them bread from heaven to eat .
Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Moses gave you not that bread from heaven ; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven .
For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven , and giveth life unto the world .
Then said they unto him , Lord , evermore give us this bread .
And Jesus said unto them , I am the bread of life : he that cometh to me shall never hunger ; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst .
But I said unto you , That ye also have seen me , and believe not .
All that the Father giveth me shall come to me ; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
For I came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me .
And this is the Father ' s will which hath sent me , that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing , but should raise it up again at the last day .
And this is the will of him that sent me , that every one which seeth the Son , and believeth on him , may have everlasting life : and I will raise him up at the last day .
The Jews then murmured at him , because he said , I am the bread which came down from heaven .
And they said , Is not this Jesus , the son of Joseph , whose father and mother we know ? how is it then that he saith , I came down from heaven ?
Jesus therefore answered and said unto them , Murmur not among yourselves .
No man can come to me , except the Father which hath sent me draw him : and I will raise him up at the last day .
It is written in the prophets , And they shall be all taught of God . Every man therefore that hath heard , and hath learned of the Father , cometh unto me .
Not that any man hath seen the Father , save he which is of God , he hath seen the Father .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me hath everlasting life .
I am that bread of life .
Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness , and are dead .
This is the bread which cometh down from heaven , that a man may eat thereof , and not die .
I am the living bread which came down from heaven : if any man eat of this bread , he shall live for ever : and the bread that I will give is my flesh , which I will give for the life of the world .
The Jews therefore strove among themselves , saying , How can this man give us his flesh to eat ?
Then Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man , and drink his blood , ye have no life in you .
Whoso eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , hath eternal life ; and I will raise him up at the last day .
For my flesh is meat indeed , and my blood is drink indeed .
He that eateth my flesh , and drinketh my blood , dwelleth in me , and I in him .
As the living Father hath sent me , and I live by the Father : so he that eateth me , even he shall live by me .
This is that bread which came down from heaven : not as your fathers did eat manna , and are dead : he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever .
These things said he in the synagogue , as he taught in Capernaum .
Many therefore of his disciples , when they had heard this , said , This is an hard saying ; who can hear it ?
When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it , he said unto them , Doth this offend you ?
What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before ?
It is the spirit that quickeneth ; the flesh profiteth nothing : the words that I speak unto you , they are spirit , and they are life .
But there are some of you that believe not . For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not , and who should betray him .
And he said , Therefore said I unto you , that no man can come unto me , except it were given unto him of my Father .
From that time many of his disciples went back , and walked no more with him .
Then said Jesus unto the twelve , Will ye also go away ?
Then Simon Peter answered him , Lord , to whom shall we go ? thou hast the words of eternal life .
And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ , the Son of the living God .
Jesus answered them , Have not I chosen you twelve , and one of you is a devil ?
He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon : for he it was that should betray him , being one of the twelve .
After these things Jesus walked in Galilee : for he would not walk in Jewry , because the Jews sought to kill him .
Now the Jew ' s feast of tabernacles was at hand .
His brethren therefore said unto him , Depart hence , and go into Judaea , that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest .
For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret , and he himself seeketh to be known openly . If thou do these things , shew thyself to the world .
For neither did his brethren believe in him .
Then Jesus said unto them , My time is not yet come : but your time is alway ready .
The world cannot hate you ; but me it hateth , because I testify of it , that the works thereof are evil .
Go ye up unto this feast : I go not up yet unto this feast : for my time is not yet full come .
When he had said these words unto them , he abode still in Galilee .
But when his brethren were gone up , then went he also up unto the feast , not openly , but as it were in secret .
Then the Jews sought him at the feast , and said , Where is he ?
And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him : for some said , He is a good man : others said , Nay ; but he deceiveth the people .
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews .
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple , and taught .
And the Jews marvelled , saying , How knoweth this man letters , having never learned ?
Jesus answered them , and said , My doctrine is not mine , but his that sent me .
If any man will do his will , he shall know of the doctrine , whether it be of God , or whether I speak of myself .
He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory : but he that seeketh his glory that sent him , the same is true , and no unrighteousness is in him .
Did not Moses give you the law , and yet none of you keepeth the law ? Why go ye about to kill me ?
The people answered and said , Thou hast a devil : who goeth about to kill thee ?
Jesus answered and said unto them , I have done one work , and ye all marvel .
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision ; ( not because it is of Moses , but of the fathers ; ) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man .
If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision , that the law of Moses should not be broken ; are ye angry at me , because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day ?
Judge not according to the appearance , but judge righteous judgment .
Then said some of them of Jerusalem , Is not this he , whom they seek to kill ?
But , lo , he speaketh boldly , and they say nothing unto him . Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ ?
Howbeit we know this man whence he is : but when Christ cometh , no man knoweth whence he is .
Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught , saying , Ye both know me , and ye know whence I am : and I am not come of myself , but he that sent me is true , whom ye know not .
But I know him : for I am from him , and he hath sent me .
Then they sought to take him : but no man laid hands on him , because his hour was not yet come .
And many of the people believed on him , and said , When Christ cometh , will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done ?
The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him ; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him .
Then said Jesus unto them , Yet a little while am I with you , and then I go unto him that sent me .
Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye cannot come .
Then said the Jews among themselves , Whither will he go , that we shall not find him ? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles , and teach the Gentiles ?
What manner of saying is this that he said , Ye shall seek me , and shall not find me : and where I am , thither ye cannot come ?
In the last day , that great day of the feast , Jesus stood and cried , saying , If any man thirst , let him come unto me , and drink .
He that believeth on me , as the scripture hath said , out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water .
( But this spake he of the Spirit , which they that believe on him should receive : for the Holy Ghost was not yet given ; because that Jesus was not yet glorified . )
Many of the people therefore , when they heard this saying , said , Of a truth this is the Prophet .
Others said , This is the Christ . But some said , Shall Christ come out of Galilee ?
Hath not the scripture said , That Christ cometh of the seed of David , and out of the town of Bethlehem , where David was ?
So there was a division among the people because of him .
And some of them would have taken him ; but no man laid hands on him .
Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees ; and they said unto them , Why have ye not brought him ?
The officers answered , Never man spake like this man .
Then answered them the Pharisees , Are ye also deceived ?
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him ?
But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed .
Nicodemus saith unto them , ( he that came to Jesus by night , being one of them , )
Doth our law judge any man , before it hear him , and know what he doeth ?
They answered and said unto him , Art thou also of Galilee ? Search , and look : for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet .
And every man went unto his own house .
Jesus went unto the mount of Olives .
And early in the morning he came again into the temple , and all the people came unto him ; and he sat down , and taught them .
And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery ; and when they had set her in the midst ,
They say unto him , Master , this woman was taken in adultery , in the very act .
Now Moses in the law commanded us , that such should be stoned : but what sayest thou ?
This they said , tempting him , that they might have to accuse him . But Jesus stooped down , and with his finger wrote on the ground , as though he heard them not .
So when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself , and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her .
And again he stooped down , and wrote on the ground .
And they which heard it , being convicted by their own conscience , went out one by one , beginning at the eldest , even unto the last : and Jesus was left alone , and the woman standing in the midst .
When Jesus had lifted up himself , and saw none but the woman , he said unto her , Woman , where are those thine accusers ? hath no man condemned thee ?
She said , No man , Lord . And Jesus said unto her , Neither do I condemn thee : go , and sin no more .
Then spake Jesus again unto them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life .
The Pharisees therefore said unto him , Thou bearest record of thyself ; thy record is not true .
Jesus answered and said unto them , Though I bear record of myself , yet my record is true : for I know whence I came , and whither I go ; but ye cannot tell whence I come , and whither I go .
Ye judge after the flesh ; I judge no man .
And yet if I judge , my judgment is true : for I am not alone , but I and the Father that sent me .
It is also written in your law , that the testimony of two men is true .
I am one that bear witness of myself , and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me .
Then said they unto him , Where is thy Father ? Jesus answered , Ye neither know me , nor my Father : if ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also .
These words spake Jesus in the treasury , as he taught in the temple : and no man laid hands on him ; for his hour was not yet come .
Then said Jesus again unto them , I go my way , and ye shall seek me , and shall die in your sins : whither I go , ye cannot come .
Then said the Jews , Will he kill himself ? because he saith , Whither I go , ye cannot come .
And he said unto them , Ye are from beneath ; I am from above : ye are of this world ; I am not of this world .
I said therefore unto you , that ye shall die in your sins : for if ye believe not that I am he , ye shall die in your sins .
Then said they unto him , Who art thou ? And Jesus saith unto them , Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning .
I have many things to say and to judge of you : but he that sent me is true ; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him .
They understood not that he spake to them of the Father .
Then said Jesus unto them , When ye have lifted up the Son of man , then shall ye know that I am he , and that I do nothing of myself ; but as my Father hath taught me , I speak these things .
And he that sent me is with me : the Father hath not left me alone ; for I do always those things that please him .
As he spake these words , many believed on him .
Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him , If ye continue in my word , then are ye my disciples indeed ;
And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free .
They answered him , We be Abraham ' s seed , and were never in bondage to any man : how sayest thou , Ye shall be made free ?
Jesus answered them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin .
And the servant abideth not in the house for ever : but the Son abideth ever .
If the Son therefore shall make you free , ye shall be free indeed .
I know that ye are Abraham ' s seed ; but ye seek to kill me , because my word hath no place in you .
I speak that which I have seen with my Father : and ye do that which ye have seen with your father .
They answered and said unto him , Abraham is our father . Jesus saith unto them , If ye were Abraham ' s children , ye would do the works of Abraham .
But now ye seek to kill me , a man that hath told you the truth , which I have heard of God : this did not Abraham .
Ye do the deeds of your father . Then said they to him , We be not born of fornication ; we have one Father , even God .
Jesus said unto them , If God were your Father , ye would love me : for I proceeded forth and came from God ; neither came I of myself , but he sent me .
Why do ye not understand my speech ? even because ye cannot hear my word .
Ye are of your father the devil , and the lusts of your father ye will do . He was a murderer from the beginning , and abode not in the truth , because there is no truth in him . When he speaketh a lie , he speaketh of his own : for he is a liar , and the father of it .
And because I tell you the truth , ye believe me not .
Which of you convinceth me of sin ? And if I say the truth , why do ye not believe me ?
He that is of God heareth God ' s words : ye therefore hear them not , because ye are not of God .
Then answered the Jews , and said unto him , Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan , and hast a devil ?
Jesus answered , I have not a devil ; but I honour my Father , and ye do dishonour me .
And I seek not mine own glory : there is one that seeketh and judgeth .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , If a man keep my saying , he shall never see death .
Then said the Jews unto him , Now we know that thou hast a devil . Abraham is dead , and the prophets ; and thou sayest , If a man keep my saying , he shall never taste of death .
Art thou greater than our father Abraham , which is dead ? and the prophets are dead : whom makest thou thyself ?
Jesus answered , If I honour myself , my honour is nothing : it is my Father that honoureth me ; of whom ye say , that he is your God :
Yet ye have not known him ; but I know him : and if I should say , I know him not , I shall be a liar like unto you : but I know him , and keep his saying .
Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day : and he saw it , and was glad .
Then said the Jews unto him , Thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ?
Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was , I am .
Then took they up stones to cast at him : but Jesus hid himself , and went out of the temple , going through the midst of them , and so passed by .
And as Jesus passed by , he saw a man which was blind from his birth .
And his disciples asked him , saying , Master , who did sin , this man , or his parents , that he was born blind ?
Jesus answered , Neither hath this man sinned , nor his parents : but that the works of God should be made manifest in him .
I must work the works of him that sent me , while it is day : the night cometh , when no man can work .
As long as I am in the world , I am the light of the world .
When he had thus spoken , he spat on the ground , and made clay of the spittle , and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay ,
And said unto him , Go , wash in the pool of Siloam , ( which is by interpretation , Sent . ) He went his way therefore , and washed , and came seeing .
The neighbours therefore , and they which before had seen him that he was blind , said , Is not this he that sat and begged ?
Some said , This is he : others said , He is like him : but he said , I am he .
Therefore said they unto him , How were thine eyes opened ?
He answered and said , A man that is called Jesus made clay , and anointed mine eyes , and said unto me , Go to the pool of Siloam , and wash : and I went and washed , and I received sight .
Then said they unto him , Where is he ? He said , I know not .
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind .
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay , and opened his eyes .
Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight . He said unto them , He put clay upon mine eyes , and I washed , and do see .
Therefore said some of the Pharisees , This man is not of God , because he keepeth not the sabbath day . Others said , How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles ? And there was a division among them .
They say unto the blind man again , What sayest thou of him , that he hath opened thine eyes ? He said , He is a prophet .
But the Jews did not believe concerning him , that he had been blind , and received his sight , until they called the parents of him that had received his sight .
And they asked them , saying , Is this your son , who ye say was born blind ? how then doth he now see ?
His parents answered them and said , We know that this is our son , and that he was born blind :
But by what means he now seeth , we know not ; or who hath opened his eyes , we know not : he is of age ; ask him : he shall speak for himself .
These words spake his parents , because they feared the Jews : for the Jews had agreed already , that if any man did confess that he was Christ , he should be put out of the synagogue .
Therefore said his parents , He is of age ; ask him .
Then again called they the man that was blind , and said unto him , Give God the praise : we know that this man is a sinner .
He answered and said , Whether he be a sinner or no , I know not : one thing I know , that , whereas I was blind , now I see .
Then said they to him again , What did he to thee ? how opened he thine eyes ?
He answered them , I have told you already , and ye did not hear : wherefore would ye hear it again ? will ye also be his disciples ?
Then they reviled him , and said , Thou art his disciple ; but we are Moses ' disciples .
We know that God spake unto Moses : as for this fellow , we know not from whence he is .
The man answered and said unto them , Why herein is a marvellous thing , that ye know not from whence he is , and yet he hath opened mine eyes .
Now we know that God heareth not sinners : but if any man be a worshipper of God , and doeth his will , him he heareth .
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind .
If this man were not of God , he could do nothing .
They answered and said unto him , Thou wast altogether born in sins , and dost thou teach us ? And they cast him out .
Jesus heard that they had cast him out ; and when he had found him , he said unto him , Dost thou believe on the Son of God ?
He answered and said , Who is he , Lord , that I might believe on him ?
And Jesus said unto him , Thou hast both seen him , and it is he that talketh with thee .
And he said , Lord , I believe . And he worshipped him .
And Jesus said , For judgment I am come into this world , that they which see not might see ; and that they which see might be made blind .
And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words , and said unto him , Are we blind also ?
Jesus said unto them , If ye were blind , ye should have no sin : but now ye say , We see ; therefore your sin remaineth .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold , but climbeth up some other way , the same is a thief and a robber .
But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep .
To him the porter openeth ; and the sheep hear his voice : and he calleth his own sheep by name , and leadeth them out .
And when he putteth forth his own sheep , he goeth before them , and the sheep follow him : for they know his voice .
And a stranger will they not follow , but will flee from him : for they know not the voice of strangers .
This parable spake Jesus unto them : but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them .
Then said Jesus unto them again , Verily , verily , I say unto you , I am the door of the sheep .
All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers : but the sheep did not hear them .
I am the door : by me if any man enter in , he shall be saved , and shall go in and out , and find pasture .
The thief cometh not , but for to steal , and to kill , and to destroy : I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more abundantly .
I am the good shepherd : the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep .
But he that is an hireling , and not the shepherd , whose own the sheep are not , seeth the wolf coming , and leaveth the sheep , and fleeth : and the wolf catcheth them , and scattereth the sheep .
The hireling fleeth , because he is an hireling , and careth not for the sheep .
I am the good shepherd , and know my sheep , and am known of mine .
As the Father knoweth me , even so know I the Father : and I lay down my life for the sheep .
And other sheep I have , which are not of this fold : them also I must bring , and they shall hear my voice ; and there shall be one fold , and one shepherd .
Therefore doth my Father love me , because I lay down my life , that I might take it again .
No man taketh it from me , but I lay it down of myself . I have power to lay it down , and I have power to take it again . This commandment have I received of my Father .
There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings .
And many of them said , He hath a devil , and is mad ; why hear ye him ?
Others said , These are not the words of him that hath a devil . Can a devil open the eyes of the blind ?
And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication , and it was winter .
And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon ' s porch .
Then came the Jews round about him , and said unto him , How long dost thou make us to doubt ? If thou be the Christ , tell us plainly .
Jesus answered them , I told you , and ye believed not : the works that I do in my Father ' s name , they bear witness of me .
But ye believe not , because ye are not of my sheep , as I said unto you .
My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me :
And I give unto them eternal life ; and they shall never perish , neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand .
My Father , which gave them me , is greater than all ; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father ' s hand .
I and my Father are one .
Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him .
Jesus answered them , Many good works have I shewed you from my Father ; for which of those works do ye stone me ?
The Jews answered him , saying , For a good work we stone thee not ; but for blasphemy ; and because that thou , being a man , makest thyself God .
Jesus answered them , Is it not written in your law , I said , Ye are gods ?
If he called them gods , unto whom the word of God came , and the scripture cannot be broken ;
Say ye of him , whom the Father hath sanctified , and sent into the world , Thou blasphemest ; because I said , I am the Son of God ?
If I do not the works of my Father , believe me not .
But if I do , though ye believe not me , believe the works : that ye may know , and believe , that the Father is in me , and I in him .
Therefore they sought again to take him : but he escaped out of their hand ,
And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized ; and there he abode .
And many resorted unto him , and said , John did no miracle : but all things that John spake of this man were true .
And many believed on him there .
Now a certain man was sick , named Lazarus , of Bethany , the town of Mary and her sister Martha .
( It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment , and wiped his feet with her hair , whose brother Lazarus was sick . )
Therefore his sisters sent unto him , saying , Lord , behold , he whom thou lovest is sick .
When Jesus heard that , he said , This sickness is not unto death , but for the glory of God , that the Son of God might be glorified thereby .
Now Jesus loved Martha , and her sister , and Lazarus .
When he had heard therefore that he was sick , he abode two days still in the same place where he was .
Then after that saith he to his disciples , Let us go into Judaea again .
His disciples say unto him , Master , the Jews of late sought to stone thee ; and goest thou thither again ?
Jesus answered , Are there not twelve hours in the day ? If any man walk in the day , he stumbleth not , because he seeth the light of this world .
But if a man walk in the night , he stumbleth , because there is no light in him .
These things said he : and after that he saith unto them , Our friend Lazarus sleepeth ; but I go , that I may awake him out of sleep .
Then said his disciples , Lord , if he sleep , he shall do well .
Howbeit Jesus spake of his death : but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep .
Then said Jesus unto them plainly , Lazarus is dead .
And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there , to the intent ye may believe ; nevertheless let us go unto him .
Then said Thomas , which is called Didymus , unto his fellowdisciples , Let us also go , that we may die with him .
Then when Jesus came , he found that he had lain in the grave four days already .
Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem , about fifteen furlongs off :
And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary , to comfort them concerning their brother .
Then Martha , as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming , went and met him : but Mary sat still in the house .
Then said Martha unto Jesus , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
But I know , that even now , whatsoever thou wilt ask of God , God will give it thee .
Jesus saith unto her , Thy brother shall rise again .
Martha saith unto him , I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day .
Jesus said unto her , I am the resurrection , and the life : he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live :
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . Believest thou this ?
She saith unto him , Yea , Lord : I believe that thou art the Christ , the Son of God , which should come into the world .
And when she had so said , she went her way , and called Mary her sister secretly , saying , The Master is come , and calleth for thee .
As soon as she heard that , she arose quickly , and came unto him .
Now Jesus was not yet come into the town , but was in that place where Martha met him .
The Jews then which were with her in the house , and comforted her , when they saw Mary , that she rose up hastily and went out , followed her , saying , She goeth unto the grave to weep there .
Then when Mary was come where Jesus was , and saw him , she fell down at his feet , saying unto him , Lord , if thou hadst been here , my brother had not died .
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping , and the Jews also weeping which came with her , he groaned in the spirit , and was troubled .
And said , Where have ye laid him ? They said unto him , Lord , come and see .
Jesus wept .
Then said the Jews , Behold how he loved him !
And some of them said , Could not this man , which opened the eyes of the blind , have caused that even this man should not have died ?
Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave . It was a cave , and a stone lay upon it .
Jesus said , Take ye away the stone . Martha , the sister of him that was dead , saith unto him , Lord , by this time he stinketh : for he hath been dead four days .
Jesus saith unto her , Said I not unto thee , that , if thou wouldest believe , thou shouldest see the glory of God ?
Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid . And Jesus lifted up his eyes , and said , Father , I thank thee that thou hast heard me .
And I knew that thou hearest me always : but because of the people which stand by I said it , that they may believe that thou hast sent me .
And when he thus had spoken , he cried with a loud voice , Lazarus , come forth .
And he that was dead came forth , bound hand and foot with graveclothes : and his face was bound about with a napkin . Jesus saith unto them , Loose him , and let him go .
Then many of the Jews which came to Mary , and had seen the things which Jesus did , believed on him .
But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees , and told them what things Jesus had done .
Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council , and said , What do we ? for this man doeth many miracles .
If we let him thus alone , all men will believe on him : and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation .
And one of them , named Caiaphas , being the high priest that same year , said unto them , Ye know nothing at all ,
Nor consider that it is expedient for us , that one man should die for the people , and that the whole nation perish not .
And this spake he not of himself : but being high priest that year , he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation ;
And not for that nation only , but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad .
Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death .
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews ; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness , into a city called Ephraim , and there continued with his disciples .
And the Jews ' passover was nigh at hand : and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover , to purify themselves .
Then sought they for Jesus , and spake among themselves , as they stood in the temple , What think ye , that he will not come to the feast ?
Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment , that , if any man knew where he were , he should shew it , that they might take him .
Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany , where Lazarus was , which had been dead , whom he raised from the dead .
There they made him a supper ; and Martha served : but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him .
Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard , very costly , and anointed the feet of Jesus , and wiped his feet with her hair : and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment .
Then saith one of his disciples , Judas Iscariot , Simon ' s son , which should betray him ,
Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence , and given to the poor ?
This he said , not that he cared for the poor ; but because he was a thief , and had the bag , and bare what was put therein .
Then said Jesus , Let her alone : against the day of my burying hath she kept this .
For the poor always ye have with you ; but me ye have not always .
Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there : and they came not for Jesus ' sake only , but that they might see Lazarus also , whom he had raised from the dead .
But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death ;
Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away , and believed on Jesus .
On the next day much people that were come to the feast , when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem ,
Took branches of palm trees , and went forth to meet him , and cried , Hosanna : Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord .
And Jesus , when he had found a young ass , sat thereon ; as it is written ,
Fear not , daughter of Sion : behold , thy King cometh , sitting on an ass ' s colt .
These things understood not his disciples at the first : but when Jesus was glorified , then remembered they that these things were written of him , and that they had done these things unto him .
The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave , and raised him from the dead , bare record .
For this cause the people also met him , for that they heard that he had done this miracle .
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves , Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing ? behold , the world is gone after him .
And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast :
The same came therefore to Philip , which was of Bethsaida of Galilee , and desired him , saying , Sir , we would see Jesus .
Philip cometh and telleth Andrew : and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus .
And Jesus answered them , saying , The hour is come , that the Son of man should be glorified .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die , it abideth alone : but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
He that loveth his life shall lose it ; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal .
If any man serve me , let him follow me ; and where I am , there shall also my servant be : if any man serve me , him will my Father honour .
Now is my soul troubled ; and what shall I say ? Father , save me from this hour : but for this cause came I unto this hour .
Father , glorify thy name . Then came there a voice from heaven , saying , I have both glorified it , and will glorify it again .
The people therefore , that stood by , and heard it , said that it thundered : others said , An angel spake to him .
Jesus answered and said , This voice came not because of me , but for your sakes .
Now is the judgment of this world : now shall the prince of this world be cast out .
And I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all men unto me .
This he said , signifying what death he should die .
The people answered him , We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever : and how sayest thou , The Son of man must be lifted up ? who is this Son of man ?
Then Jesus said unto them , Yet a little while is the light with you . Walk while ye have the light , lest darkness come upon you : for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth .
While ye have light , believe in the light , that ye may be the children of light . These things spake Jesus , and departed , and did hide himself from them .
But though he had done so many miracles before them , yet they believed not on him :
That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled , which he spake , Lord , who hath believed our report ? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed ?
Therefore they could not believe , because that Esaias said again ,
He hath blinded their eyes , and hardened their heart ; that they should not see with their eyes , nor understand with their heart , and be converted , and I should heal them .
These things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him .
Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him ; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him , lest they should be put out of the synagogue :
For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God .
Jesus cried and said , He that believeth on me , believeth not on me , but on him that sent me .
And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me .
I am come a light into the world , that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness .
And if any man hear my words , and believe not , I judge him not : for I came not to judge the world , but to save the world .
He that rejecteth me , and receiveth not my words , hath one that judgeth him : the word that I have spoken , the same shall judge him in the last day .
For I have not spoken of myself ; but the Father which sent me , he gave me a commandment , what I should say , and what I should speak .
And I know that his commandment is life everlasting : whatsoever I speak therefore , even as the Father said unto me , so I speak .
Now before the feast of the passover , when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father , having loved his own which were in the world , he loved them unto the end .
And supper being ended , the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot , Simon ' s son , to betray him ;
Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands , and that he was come from God , and went to God ;
He riseth from supper , and laid aside his garments ; and took a towel , and girded himself .
After that he poureth water into a bason , and began to wash the disciples ' feet , and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded .
Then cometh he to Simon Peter : and Peter saith unto him , Lord , dost thou wash my feet ?
Jesus answered and said unto him , What I do thou knowest not now ; but thou shalt know hereafter .
Peter saith unto him , Thou shalt never wash my feet . Jesus answered him , If I wash thee not , thou hast no part with me .
Simon Peter saith unto him , Lord , not my feet only , but also my hands and my head .
Jesus saith to him , He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet , but is clean every whit : and ye are clean , but not all .
For he knew who should betray him ; therefore said he , Ye are not all clean .
So after he had washed their feet , and had taken his garments , and was set down again , he said unto them , Know ye what I have done to you ?
Ye call me Master and Lord : and ye say well ; for so I am .
If I then , your Lord and Master , have washed your feet ; ye also ought to wash one another ' s feet .
For I have given you an example , that ye should do as I have done to you .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord ; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him .
If ye know these things , happy are ye if ye do them .
I speak not of you all : I know whom I have chosen : but that the scripture may be fulfilled , He that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me .
Now I tell you before it come , that , when it is come to pass , ye may believe that I am he .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me ; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me .
When Jesus had thus said , he was troubled in spirit , and testified , and said , Verily , verily , I say unto you , that one of you shall betray me .
Then the disciples looked one on another , doubting of whom he spake .
Now there was leaning on Jesus ' bosom one of his disciples , whom Jesus loved .
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him , that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake .
He then lying on Jesus ' breast saith unto him , Lord , who is it ?
Jesus answered , He it is , to whom I shall give a sop , when I have dipped it . And when he had dipped the sop , he gave it to Judas Iscariot , the son of Simon .
And after the sop Satan entered into him . Then said Jesus unto him , That thou doest , do quickly .
Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him .
For some of them thought , because Judas had the bag , that Jesus had said unto him , Buy those things that we have need of against the feast ; or , that he should give something to the poor .
He then having received the sop went immediately out : and it was night .
Therefore , when he was gone out , Jesus said , Now is the Son of man glorified , and God is glorified in him .
If God be glorified in him , God shall also glorify him in himself , and shall straightway glorify him .
Little children , yet a little while I am with you . Ye shall seek me : and as I said unto the Jews , Whither I go , ye cannot come ; so now I say to you .
A new commandment I give unto you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another .
By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples , if ye have love one to another .
Simon Peter said unto him , Lord , whither goest thou ? Jesus answered him , Whither I go , thou canst not follow me now ; but thou shalt follow me afterwards .
Peter said unto him , Lord , why cannot I follow thee now ? I will lay down my life for thy sake .
Jesus answered him , Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake ? Verily , verily , I say unto thee , The cock shall not crow , till thou hast denied me thrice .
Let not your heart be troubled : ye believe in God , believe also in me .
In my Father ' s house are many mansions : if it were not so , I would have told you . I go to prepare a place for you .
And if I go and prepare a place for you , I will come again , and receive you unto myself ; that where I am , there ye may be also .
And whither I go ye know , and the way ye know .
Thomas saith unto him , Lord , we know not whither thou goest ; and how can we know the way ?
Jesus saith unto him , I am the way , the truth , and the life : no man cometh unto the Father , but by me .
If ye had known me , ye should have known my Father also : and from henceforth ye know him , and have seen him .
Philip saith unto him , Lord , shew us the Father , and it sufficeth us .
Jesus saith unto him , Have I been so long time with you , and yet hast thou not known me , Philip ? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father ; and how sayest thou then , Shew us the Father ?
Believest thou not that I am in the Father , and the Father in me ? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself : but the Father that dwelleth in me , he doeth the works .
Believe me that I am in the Father , and the Father in me : or else believe me for the very works ' sake .
Verily , verily , I say unto you , He that believeth on me , the works that I do shall he do also ; and greater works than these shall he do ; because I go unto my Father .
And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name , that will I do , that the Father may be glorified in the Son .
If ye shall ask any thing in my name , I will do it .
If ye love me , keep my commandments .
And I will pray the Father , and he shall give you another Comforter , that he may abide with you for ever ;
Even the Spirit of truth ; whom the world cannot receive , because it seeth him not , neither knoweth him : but ye know him ; for he dwelleth with you , and shall be in you .
I will not leave you comfortless : I will come to you .
Yet a little while , and the world seeth me no more ; but ye see me : because I live , ye shall live also .
At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father , and ye in me , and I in you .
He that hath my commandments , and keepeth them , he it is that loveth me : and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father , and I will love him , and will manifest myself to him .
Judas saith unto him , not Iscariot , Lord , how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us , and not unto the world ?
Jesus answered and said unto him , If a man love me , he will keep my words : and my Father will love him , and we will come unto him , and make our abode with him .
He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings : and the word which ye hear is not mine , but the Father ' s which sent me .
These things have I spoken unto you , being yet present with you .
But the Comforter , which is the Holy Ghost , whom the Father will send in my name , he shall teach you all things , and bring all things to your remembrance , whatsoever I have said unto you .
Peace I leave with you , my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth , give I unto you . Let not your heart be troubled , neither let it be afraid .
Ye have heard how I said unto you , I go away , and come again unto you . If ye loved me , ye would rejoice , because I said , I go unto the Father : for my Father is greater than I .
And now I have told you before it come to pass , that , when it is come to pass , ye might believe .
Hereafter I will not talk much with you : for the prince of this world cometh , and hath nothing in me .
But that the world may know that I love the Father ; and as the Father gave me commandment , even so I do . Arise , let us go hence .
I am the true vine , and my Father is the husbandman .
Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away : and every branch that beareth fruit , he purgeth it , that it may bring forth more fruit .
Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you .
Abide in me , and I in you . As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself , except it abide in the vine ; no more can ye , except ye abide in me .
I am the vine , ye are the branches : He that abideth in me , and I in him , the same bringeth forth much fruit : for without me ye can do nothing .
If a man abide not in me , he is cast forth as a branch , and is withered ; and men gather them , and cast them into the fire , and they are burned .
If ye abide in me , and my words abide in you , ye shall ask what ye will , and it shall be done unto you .
Herein is my Father glorified , that ye bear much fruit ; so shall ye be my disciples .
As the Father hath loved me , so have I loved you : continue ye in my love .
If ye keep my commandments , ye shall abide in my love ; even as I have kept my Father ' s commandments , and abide in his love .
These things have I spoken unto you , that my joy might remain in you , and that your joy might be full .
This is my commandment , That ye love one another , as I have loved you .
Greater love hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
Ye are my friends , if ye do whatsoever I command you .
Henceforth I call you not servants ; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth : but I have called you friends ; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you .
Ye have not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and ordained you , that ye should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain : that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name , he may give it you .
These things I command you , that ye love one another .
If the world hate you , ye know that it hated me before it hated you .
If ye were of the world , the world would love his own : but because ye are not of the world , but I have chosen you out of the world , therefore the world hateth you .
Remember the word that I said unto you , The servant is not greater than his lord . If they have persecuted me , they will also persecute you ; if they have kept my saying , they will keep yours also .
But all these things will they do unto you for my name ' s sake , because they know not him that sent me .
If I had not come and spoken unto them , they had not had sin : but now they have no cloak for their sin .
He that hateth me hateth my Father also .
If I had not done among them the works which none other man did , they had not had sin : but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father .
But this cometh to pass , that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law , They hated me without a cause .
But when the Comforter is come , whom I will send unto you from the Father , even the Spirit of truth , which proceedeth from the Father , he shall testify of me :
And ye also shall bear witness , because ye have been with me from the beginning .
These things have I spoken unto you , that ye should not be offended .
They shall put you out of the synagogues : yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service .
And these things will they do unto you , because they have not known the Father , nor me .
But these things have I told you , that when the time shall come , ye may remember that I told you of them . And these things I said not unto you at the beginning , because I was with you .
But now I go my way to him that sent me ; and none of you asketh me , Whither goest thou ?
But because I have said these things unto you , sorrow hath filled your heart .
Nevertheless I tell you the truth ; It is expedient for you that I go away : for if I go not away , the Comforter will not come unto you ; but if I depart , I will send him unto you .
And when he is come , he will reprove the world of sin , and of righteousness , and of judgment :
Of sin , because they believe not on me ;
Of righteousness , because I go to my Father , and ye see me no more ;
Of judgment , because the prince of this world is judged .
I have yet many things to say unto you , but ye cannot bear them now .
Howbeit when he , the Spirit of truth , is come , he will guide you into all truth : for he shall not speak of himself ; but whatsoever he shall hear , that shall he speak : and he will shew you things to come .
He shall glorify me : for he shall receive of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
All things that the Father hath are mine : therefore said I , that he shall take of mine , and shall shew it unto you .
A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me , because I go to the Father .
Then said some of his disciples among themselves , What is this that he saith unto us , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me : and , Because I go to the Father ?
They said therefore , What is this that he saith , A little while ? we cannot tell what he saith .
Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him , and said unto them , Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said , A little while , and ye shall not see me : and again , a little while , and ye shall see me ?
Verily , verily , I say unto you , That ye shall weep and lament , but the world shall rejoice : and ye shall be sorrowful , but your sorrow shall be turned into joy .
A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow , because her hour is come : but as soon as she is delivered of the child , she remembereth no more the anguish , for joy that a man is born into the world .
And ye now therefore have sorrow : but I will see you again , and your heart shall rejoice , and your joy no man taketh from you .
And in that day ye shall ask me nothing . Verily , verily , I say unto you , Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name , he will give it you .
Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name : ask , and ye shall receive , that your joy may be full .
These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs : but the time cometh , when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs , but I shall shew you plainly of the Father .
At that day ye shall ask in my name : and I say not unto you , that I will pray the Father for you :
For the Father himself loveth you , because ye have loved me , and have believed that I came out from God .
I came forth from the Father , and am come into the world : again , I leave the world , and go to the Father .
His disciples said unto him , Lo , now speakest thou plainly , and speakest no proverb .
Now are we sure that thou knowest all things , and needest not that any man should ask thee : by this we believe that thou camest forth from God .
Jesus answered them , Do ye now believe ?
Behold , the hour cometh , yea , is now come , that ye shall be scattered , every man to his own , and shall leave me alone : and yet I am not alone , because the Father is with me .
These things I have spoken unto you , that in me ye might have peace . In the world ye shall have tribulation : but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world .
These words spake Jesus , and lifted up his eyes to heaven , and said , Father , the hour is come ; glorify thy Son , that thy Son also may glorify thee :
As thou hast given him power over all flesh , that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him .
And this is life eternal , that they might know thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent .
I have glorified thee on the earth : I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do .
And now , O Father , glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was .
I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world : thine they were , and thou gavest them me ; and they have kept thy word .
Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee .
For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me ; and they have received them , and have known surely that I came out from thee , and they have believed that thou didst send me .
I pray for them : I pray not for the world , but for them which thou hast given me ; for they are thine .
And all mine are thine , and thine are mine ; and I am glorified in them .
And now I am no more in the world , but these are in the world , and I come to thee . Holy Father , keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me , that they may be one , as we are .
While I was with them in the world , I kept them in thy name : those that thou gavest me I have kept , and none of them is lost , but the son of perdition ; that the scripture might be fulfilled .
And now come I to thee ; and these things I speak in the world , that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves .
I have given them thy word ; and the world hath hated them , because they are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world , but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil .
They are not of the world , even as I am not of the world .
Sanctify them through thy truth : thy word is truth .
As thou hast sent me into the world , even so have I also sent them into the world .
And for their sakes I sanctify myself , that they also might be sanctified through the truth .
Neither pray I for these alone , but for them also which shall believe on me through their word ;
That they all may be one ; as thou , Father , art in me , and I in thee , that they also may be one in us : that the world may believe that thou hast sent me .
And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them ; that they may be one , even as we are one :
I in them , and thou in me , that they may be made perfect in one ; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me , and hast loved them , as thou hast loved me .
Father , I will that they also , whom thou hast given me , be with me where I am ; that they may behold my glory , which thou hast given me : for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world .
O righteous Father , the world hath not known thee : but I have known thee , and these have known that thou hast sent me .
And I have declared unto them thy name , and will declare it : that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them , and I in them .
When Jesus had spoken these words , he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron , where was a garden , into the which he entered , and his disciples .
And Judas also , which betrayed him , knew the place : for Jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples .
Judas then , having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees , cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons .
Jesus therefore , knowing all things that should come upon him , went forth , and said unto them , Whom seek ye ?
They answered him , Jesus of Nazareth . Jesus saith unto them , I am he . And Judas also , which betrayed him , stood with them .
As soon then as he had said unto them , I am he , they went backward , and fell to the ground .
Then asked he them again , Whom seek ye ? And they said , Jesus of Nazareth .
Jesus answered , I have told you that I am he : if therefore ye seek me , let these go their way :
That the saying might be fulfilled , which he spake , Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none .
Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it , and smote the high priest ' s servant , and cut off his right ear . The servant ' s name was Malchus .
Then said Jesus unto Peter , Put up thy sword into the sheath : the cup which my Father hath given me , shall I not drink it ?
Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus , and bound him ,
And led him away to Annas first ; for he was father in law to Caiaphas , which was the high priest that same year .
Now Caiaphas was he , which gave counsel to the Jews , that it was expedient that one man should die for the people .
And Simon Peter followed Jesus , and so did another disciple : that disciple was known unto the high priest , and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest .
But Peter stood at the door without . Then went out that other disciple , which was known unto the high priest , and spake unto her that kept the door , and brought in Peter .
Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter , Art not thou also one of this man ' s disciples ? He saith , I am not .
And the servants and officers stood there , who had made a fire of coals ; for it was cold : and they warmed themselves : and Peter stood with them , and warmed himself .
The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples , and of his doctrine .
Jesus answered him , I spake openly to the world ; I ever taught in the synagogue , and in the temple , whither the Jews always resort ; and in secret have I said nothing .
Why askest thou me ? ask them which heard me , what I have said unto them : behold , they know what I said .
And when he had thus spoken , one of the officers which stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand , saying , Answerest thou the high priest so ?
Jesus answered him , If I have spoken evil , bear witness of the evil : but if well , why smitest thou me ?
Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest .
And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself . They said therefore unto him , Art not thou also one of his disciples ? He denied it , and said , I am not .
One of the servants of the high priest , being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off , saith , Did not I see thee in the garden with him ?
Peter then denied again : and immediately the cock crew .
Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment : and it was early ; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall , lest they should be defiled ; but that they might eat the passover .
Pilate then went out unto them , and said , What accusation bring ye against this man ?
They answered and said unto him , If he were not a malefactor , we would not have delivered him up unto thee .
Then said Pilate unto them , Take ye him , and judge him according to your law . The Jews therefore said unto him , It is not lawful for us to put any man to death :
That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled , which he spake , signifying what death he should die .
Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again , and called Jesus , and said unto him , Art thou the King of the Jews ?
Jesus answered him , Sayest thou this thing of thyself , or did others tell it thee of me ?
Pilate answered , Am I a Jew ? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me : what hast thou done ?
Jesus answered , My kingdom is not of this world : if my kingdom were of this world , then would my servants fight , that I should not be delivered to the Jews : but now is my kingdom not from hence .
Pilate therefore said unto him , Art thou a king then ? Jesus answered , Thou sayest that I am a king . To this end was I born , and for this cause came I into the world , that I should bear witness unto the truth . Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice .
Pilate saith unto him , What is truth ? And when he had said this , he went out again unto the Jews , and saith unto them , I find in him no fault at all .
But ye have a custom , that I should release unto you one at the passover : will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews ?
Then cried they all again , saying , Not this man , but Barabbas . Now Barabbas was a robber .
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus , and scourged him .
And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns , and put it on his head , and they put on him a purple robe ,
And said , Hail , King of the Jews ! and they smote him with their hands .
Pilate therefore went forth again , and saith unto them , Behold , I bring him forth to you , that ye may know that I find no fault in him .
Then came Jesus forth , wearing the crown of thorns , and the purple robe . And Pilate saith unto them , Behold the man !
When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him , they cried out , saying , Crucify him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Take ye him , and crucify him : for I find no fault in him .
The Jews answered him , We have a law , and by our law he ought to die , because he made himself the Son of God .
When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he was the more afraid ;
And went again into the judgment hall , and saith unto Jesus , Whence art thou ? But Jesus gave him no answer .
Then saith Pilate unto him , Speakest thou not unto me ? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee , and have power to release thee ?
Jesus answered , Thou couldest have no power at all against me , except it were given thee from above : therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin .
And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him : but the Jews cried out , saying , If thou let this man go , thou art not Caesar ' s friend : whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar .
When Pilate therefore heard that saying , he brought Jesus forth , and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement , but in the Hebrew , Gabbatha .
And it was the preparation of the passover , and about the sixth hour : and he saith unto the Jews , Behold your King !
But they cried out , Away with him , away with him , crucify him . Pilate saith unto them , Shall I crucify your King ? The chief priests answered , We have no king but Caesar .
Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified . And they took Jesus , and led him away .
And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull , which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha :
Where they crucified him , and two other with him , on either side one , and Jesus in the midst .
And Pilate wrote a title , and put it on the cross . And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS .
This title then read many of the Jews : for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city : and it was written in Hebrew , and Greek , and Latin .
Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate , Write not , The King of the Jews ; but that he said , I am King of the Jews .
Pilate answered , What I have written I have written .
Then the soldiers , when they had crucified Jesus , took his garments , and made four parts , to every soldier a part ; and also his coat : now the coat was without seam , woven from the top throughout .
They said therefore among themselves , Let us not rend it , but cast lots for it , whose it shall be : that the scripture might be fulfilled , which saith , They parted my raiment among them , and for my vesture they did cast lots . These things therefore the soldiers did .
Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother , and his mother ' s sister , Mary the wife of Cleophas , and Mary Magdalene .
When Jesus therefore saw his mother , and the disciple standing by , whom he loved , he saith unto his mother , Woman , behold thy son !
Then saith he to the disciple , Behold thy mother ! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home .
After this , Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished , that the scripture might be fulfilled , saith , I thirst .
Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar : and they filled a spunge with vinegar , and put it upon hyssop , and put it to his mouth .
When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , It is finished : and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost .
The Jews therefore , because it was the preparation , that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day , ( for that sabbath day was an high day , ) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken , and that they might be taken away .
Then came the soldiers , and brake the legs of the first , and of the other which was crucified with him .
But when they came to Jesus , and saw that he was dead already , they brake not his legs :
But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side , and forthwith came there out blood and water .
And he that saw it bare record , and his record is true : and he knoweth that he saith true , that ye might believe .
For these things were done , that the scripture should be fulfilled , A bone of him shall not be broken .
And again another scripture saith , They shall look on him whom they pierced .
And after this Joseph of Arimathaea , being a disciple of Jesus , but secretly for fear of the Jews , besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus : and Pilate gave him leave . He came therefore , and took the body of Jesus .
And there came also Nicodemus , which at the first came to Jesus by night , and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes , about an hundred pound weight .
Then took they the body of Jesus , and wound it in linen clothes with the spices , as the manner of the Jews is to bury .
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden ; and in the garden a new sepulchre , wherein was never man yet laid .
There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews ' preparation day ; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand .
The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early , when it was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre .
Then she runneth , and cometh to Simon Peter , and to the other disciple , whom Jesus loved , and saith unto them , They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre , and we know not where they have laid him .
Peter therefore went forth , and that other disciple , and came to the sepulchre .
So they ran both together : and the other disciple did outrun Peter , and came first to the sepulchre .
And he stooping down , and looking in , saw the linen clothes lying ; yet went he not in .
Then cometh Simon Peter following him , and went into the sepulchre , and seeth the linen clothes lie ,
And the napkin , that was about his head , not lying with the linen clothes , but wrapped together in a place by itself .
Then went in also that other disciple , which came first to the sepulchre , and he saw , and believed .
For as yet they knew not the scripture , that he must rise again from the dead .
Then the disciples went away again unto their own home .
But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping : and as she wept , she stooped down , and looked into the sepulchre ,
And seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and the other at the feet , where the body of Jesus had lain .
And they say unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? She saith unto them , Because they have taken away my LORD , and I know not where they have laid him .
And when she had thus said , she turned herself back , and saw Jesus standing , and knew not that it was Jesus .
Jesus saith unto her , Woman , why weepest thou ? whom seekest thou ? She , supposing him to be the gardener , saith unto him , Sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away .
Jesus saith unto her , Mary . She turned herself , and saith unto him , Rabboni ; which is to say , Master .
Jesus saith unto her , Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , I ascend unto my Father , and your Father ; and to my God , and your God .
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD , and that he had spoken these things unto her .
Then the same day at evening , being the first day of the week , when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews , came Jesus and stood in the midst , and saith unto them , Peace be unto you .
And when he had so said , he shewed unto them his hands and his side . Then were the disciples glad , when they saw the LORD .
Then said Jesus to them again , Peace be unto you : as my Father hath sent me , even so send I you .
And when he had said this , he breathed on them , and saith unto them , Receive ye the Holy Ghost :
Whose soever sins ye remit , they are remitted unto them ; and whose soever sins ye retain , they are retained .
But Thomas , one of the twelve , called Didymus , was not with them when Jesus came .
The other disciples therefore said unto him , We have seen the LORD . But he said unto them , Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails , and put my finger into the print of the nails , and thrust my hand into his side , I will not believe .
And after eight days again his disciples were within , and Thomas with them : then came Jesus , the doors being shut , and stood in the midst , and said , Peace be unto you .
Then saith he to Thomas , Reach hither thy finger , and behold my hands ; and reach hither thy hand , and thrust it into my side : and be not faithless , but believing .
And Thomas answered and said unto him , My LORD and my God .
Jesus saith unto him , Thomas , because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed are they that have not seen , and yet have believed .
And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples , which are not written in this book :
But these are written , that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God ; and that believing ye might have life through his name .
The former treatise have I made , O Theophilus , of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ,
Until the day in which he was taken up , after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen :
To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs , being seen of them forty days , and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God :
And , being assembled together with them , commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem , but wait for the promise of the Father , which , saith he , ye have heard of me .
For John truly baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence .
When they therefore were come together , they asked of him , saying , Lord , wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel ?
And he said unto them , It is not for you to know the times or the seasons , which the Father hath put in his own power .
But ye shall receive power , after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you : and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem , and in all Judaea , and in Samaria , and unto the uttermost part of the earth .
And when he had spoken these things , while they beheld , he was taken up ; and a cloud received him out of their sight .
And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up , behold , two men stood by them in white apparel ;
Which also said , Ye men of Galilee , why stand ye gazing up into heaven ? this same Jesus , which is taken up from you into heaven , shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven .
Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet , which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day ' s journey .
And when they were come in , they went up into an upper room , where abode both Peter , and James , and John , and Andrew , Philip , and Thomas , Bartholomew , and Matthew , James the son of Alphaeus , and Simon Zelotes , and Judas the brother of James .
These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication , with the women , and Mary the mother of Jesus , and with his brethren .
And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples , and said , ( the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty , )
Men and brethren , this scripture must needs have been fulfilled , which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas , which was guide to them that took Jesus .
For he was numbered with us , and had obtained part of this ministry .
Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity ; and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst , and all his bowels gushed out .
And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem ; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue , Aceldama , that is to say , The field of blood .
For it is written in the book of Psalms , Let his habitation be desolate , and let no man dwell therein : and his bishoprick let another take .
Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us ,
Beginning from the baptism of John , unto that same day that he was taken up from us , must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection .
And they appointed two , Joseph called Barsabas , who was surnamed Justus , and Matthias .
And they prayed , and said , Thou , Lord , which knowest the hearts of all men , shew whether of these two thou hast chosen ,
That he may take part of this ministry and apostleship , from which Judas by transgression fell , that he might go to his own place .
And they gave forth their lots ; and the lot fell upon Matthias ; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles .
And when the day of Pentecost was fully come , they were all with one accord in one place .
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind , and it filled all the house where they were sitting .
And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire , and it sat upon each of them .
And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and began to speak with other tongues , as the Spirit gave them utterance .
And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews , devout men , out of every nation under heaven .
Now when this was noised abroad , the multitude came together , and were confounded , because that every man heard them speak in his own language .
And they were all amazed and marvelled , saying one to another , Behold , are not all these which speak Galilaeans ?
And how hear we every man in our own tongue , wherein we were born ?
Parthians , and Medes , and Elamites , and the dwellers in Mesopotamia , and in Judaea , and Cappadocia , in Pontus , and Asia ,
Phrygia , and Pamphylia , in Egypt , and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene , and strangers of Rome , Jews and proselytes ,
Cretes and Arabians , we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God .
And they were all amazed , and were in doubt , saying one to another , What meaneth this ?
Others mocking said , These men are full of new wine .
But Peter , standing up with the eleven , lifted up his voice , and said unto them , Ye men of Judaea , and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem , be this known unto you , and hearken to my words :
For these are not drunken , as ye suppose , seeing it is but the third hour of the day .
But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel ;
And it shall come to pass in the last days , saith God , I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh : and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy , and your young men shall see visions , and your old men shall dream dreams :
And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit ; and they shall prophesy :
And I will shew wonders in heaven above , and signs in the earth beneath ; blood , and fire , and vapour of smoke :
The sun shall be turned into darkness , and the moon into blood , before the great and notable day of the Lord come :
And it shall come to pass , that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved .
Ye men of Israel , hear these words ; Jesus of Nazareth , a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs , which God did by him in the midst of you , as ye yourselves also know :
Him , being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God , ye have taken , and by wicked hands have crucified and slain :
Whom God hath raised up , having loosed the pains of death : because it was not possible that he should be holden of it .
For David speaketh concerning him , I foresaw the Lord always before my face , for he is on my right hand , that I should not be moved :
Therefore did my heart rejoice , and my tongue was glad ; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope :
Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell , neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
Thou hast made known to me the ways of life ; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance .
Men and brethren , let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David , that he is both dead and buried , and his sepulchre is with us unto this day .
Therefore being a prophet , and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him , that of the fruit of his loins , according to the flesh , he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne ;
He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ , that his soul was not left in hell , neither his flesh did see corruption .
This Jesus hath God raised up , whereof we all are witnesses .
Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted , and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost , he hath shed forth this , which ye now see and hear .
For David is not ascended into the heavens : but he saith himself , The Lord said unto my Lord , Sit thou on my right hand ,
Until I make thy foes thy footstool .
Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly , that God hath made the same Jesus , whom ye have crucified , both Lord and Christ .
Now when they heard this , they were pricked in their heart , and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles , Men and brethren , what shall we do ?
Then Peter said unto them , Repent , and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins , and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost .
For the promise is unto you , and to your children , and to all that are afar off , even as many as the LORD our God shall call .
And with many other words did he testify and exhort , saying , Save yourselves from this untoward generation .
Then they that gladly received his word were baptized : and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls .
And they continued stedfastly in the apostles ' doctrine and fellowship , and in breaking of bread , and in prayers .
And fear came upon every soul : and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles .
And all that believed were together , and had all things common ;
And sold their possessions and goods , and parted them to all men , as every man had need .
And they , continuing daily with one accord in the temple , and breaking bread from house to house , did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart ,
Praising God , and having favour with all the people . And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved .
Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer , being the ninth hour .
And a certain man lame from his mother ' s womb was carried , whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful , to ask alms of them that entered into the temple ;
Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms .
And Peter , fastening his eyes upon him with John , said , Look on us .
And he gave heed unto them , expecting to receive something of them .
Then Peter said , Silver and gold have I none ; but such as I have give I thee : In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk .
And he took him by the right hand , and lifted him up : and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength .
And he leaping up stood , and walked , and entered with them into the temple , walking , and leaping , and praising God .
And all the people saw him walking and praising God :
And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple : and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him .
And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John , all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon ' s , greatly wondering .
And when Peter saw it , he answered unto the people , Ye men of Israel , why marvel ye at this ? or why look ye so earnestly on us , as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk ?
The God of Abraham , and of Isaac , and of Jacob , the God of our fathers , hath glorified his Son Jesus ; whom ye delivered up , and denied him in the presence of Pilate , when he was determined to let him go .
But ye denied the Holy One and the Just , and desired a murderer to be granted unto you ;
And killed the Prince of life , whom God hath raised from the dead ; whereof we are witnesses .
And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong , whom ye see and know : yea , the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all .
And now , brethren , I wot that through ignorance ye did it , as did also your rulers .
But those things , which God before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets , that Christ should suffer , he hath so fulfilled .
Repent ye therefore , and be converted , that your sins may be blotted out , when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord .
And he shall send Jesus Christ , which before was preached unto you :
Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things , which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began .
For Moses truly said unto the fathers , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you .
And it shall come to pass , that every soul , which will not hear that prophet , shall be destroyed from among the people .
Yea , and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after , as many as have spoken , have likewise foretold of these days .
Ye are the children of the prophets , and of the covenant which God made with our fathers , saying unto Abraham , And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed .
Unto you first God , having raised up his Son Jesus , sent him to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his iniquities .
And as they spake unto the people , the priests , and the captain of the temple , and the Sadducees , came upon them ,
Being grieved that they taught the people , and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead .
And they laid hands on them , and put them in hold unto the next day : for it was now eventide .
Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed ; and the number of the men was about five thousand .
And it came to pass on the morrow , that their rulers , and elders , and scribes ,
And Annas the high priest , and Caiaphas , and John , and Alexander , and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest , were gathered together at Jerusalem .
And when they had set them in the midst , they asked , By what power , or by what name , have ye done this ?
Then Peter , filled with the Holy Ghost , said unto them , Ye rulers of the people , and elders of Israel ,
If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man , by what means he is made whole ;
Be it known unto you all , and to all the people of Israel , that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth , whom ye crucified , whom God raised from the dead , even by him doth this man stand here before you whole .
This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders , which is become the head of the corner .
Neither is there salvation in any other : for there is none other name under heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved .
Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John , and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men , they marvelled ; and they took knowledge of them , that they had been with Jesus .
And beholding the man which was healed standing with them , they could say nothing against it .
But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council , they conferred among themselves ,
Saying , What shall we do to these men ? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem ; and we cannot deny it .
But that it spread no further among the people , let us straitly threaten them , that they speak henceforth to no man in this name .
And they called them , and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus .
But Peter and John answered and said unto them , Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God , judge ye .
For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard .
So when they had further threatened them , they let them go , finding nothing how they might punish them , because of the people : for all men glorified God for that which was done .
For the man was above forty years old , on whom this miracle of healing was shewed .
And being let go , they went to their own company , and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them .
And when they heard that , they lifted up their voice to God with one accord , and said , Lord , thou art God , which hast made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all that in them is :
Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said , Why did the heathen rage , and the people imagine vain things ?
The kings of the earth stood up , and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord , and against his Christ .
For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus , whom thou hast anointed , both Herod , and Pontius Pilate , with the Gentiles , and the people of Israel , were gathered together ,
For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done .
And now , Lord , behold their threatenings : and grant unto thy servants , that with all boldness they may speak thy word ,
By stretching forth thine hand to heal ; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus .
And when they had prayed , the place was shaken where they were assembled together ; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost , and they spake the word of God with boldness .
And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul : neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own ; but they had all things common .
And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus : and great grace was upon them all .
Neither was there any among them that lacked : for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them , and brought the prices of the things that were sold ,
And laid them down at the apostles ' feet : and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need .
And Joses , who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas , ( which is , being interpreted , The son of consolation , ) a Levite , and of the country of Cyprus ,
Having land , sold it , and brought the money , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
But a certain man named Ananias , with Sapphira his wife , sold a possession ,
And kept back part of the price , his wife also being privy to it , and brought a certain part , and laid it at the apostles ' feet .
But Peter said , Ananias , why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost , and to keep back part of the price of the land ?
Whiles it remained , was it not thine own ? and after it was sold , was it not in thine own power ? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart ? thou hast not lied unto men , but unto God .
And Ananias hearing these words fell down , and gave up the ghost : and great fear came on all them that heard these things .
And the young men arose , wound him up , and carried him out , and buried him .
And it was about the space of three hours after , when his wife , not knowing what was done , came in .
And Peter answered unto her , Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much ? And she said , Yea , for so much .
Then Peter said unto her , How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord ? behold , the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door , and shall carry thee out .
Then fell she down straightway at his feet , and yielded up the ghost : and the young men came in , and found her dead , and , carrying her forth , buried her by her husband .
And great fear came upon all the church , and upon as many as heard these things .
And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people ; ( and they were all with one accord in Solomon ' s porch .
And of the rest durst no man join himself to them : but the people magnified them .
And believers were the more added to the Lord , multitudes both of men and women . )
Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets , and laid them on beds and couches , that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them .
There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem , bringing sick folks , and them which were vexed with unclean spirits : and they were healed every one .
Then the high priest rose up , and all they that were with him , ( which is the sect of the Sadducees , ) and were filled with indignation ,
And laid their hands on the apostles , and put them in the common prison .
But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors , and brought them forth , and said ,
Go , stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life .
And when they heard that , they entered into the temple early in the morning , and taught . But the high priest came , and they that were with him , and called the council together , and all the senate of the children of Israel , and sent to the prison to have them brought .
But when the officers came , and found them not in the prison , they returned and told ,
Saying , The prison truly found we shut with all safety , and the keepers standing without before the doors : but when we had opened , we found no man within .
Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things , they doubted of them whereunto this would grow .
Then came one and told them , saying , Behold , the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple , and teaching the people .
Then went the captain with the officers , and brought them without violence : for they feared the people , lest they should have been stoned .
And when they had brought them , they set them before the council : and the high priest asked them ,
Saying , Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name ? and , behold , ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine , and intend to bring this man ' s blood upon us .
Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said , We ought to obey God rather than men .
The God of our fathers raised up Jesus , whom ye slew and hanged on a tree .
Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour , for to give repentance to Israel , and forgiveness of sins .
And we are his witnesses of these things ; and so is also the Holy Ghost , whom God hath given to them that obey him .
When they heard that , they were cut to the heart , and took counsel to slay them .
Then stood there up one in the council , a Pharisee , named Gamaliel , a doctor of the law , had in reputation among all the people , and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space ;
And said unto them , Ye men of Israel , take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men .
For before these days rose up Theudas , boasting himself to be somebody ; to whom a number of men , about four hundred , joined themselves : who was slain ; and all , as many as obeyed him , were scattered , and brought to nought .
After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing , and drew away much people after him : he also perished ; and all , even as many as obeyed him , were dispersed .
And now I say unto you , Refrain from these men , and let them alone : for if this counsel or this work be of men , it will come to nought :
But if it be of God , ye cannot overthrow it ; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God .
And to him they agreed : and when they had called the apostles , and beaten them , they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus , and let them go .
And they departed from the presence of the council , rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name .
And daily in the temple , and in every house , they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ .
And in those days , when the number of the disciples was multiplied , there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews , because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration .
Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them , and said , It is not reason that we should leave the word of God , and serve tables .
Wherefore , brethren , look ye out among you seven men of honest report , full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom , whom we may appoint over this business .
But we will give ourselves continually to prayer , and to the ministry of the word .
And the saying pleased the whole multitude : and they chose Stephen , a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost , and Philip , and Prochorus , and Nicanor , and Timon , and Parmenas , and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch :
Whom they set before the apostles : and when they had prayed , they laid their hands on them .
And the word of God increased ; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly ; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith .
And Stephen , full of faith and power , did great wonders and miracles among the people .
Then there arose certain of the synagogue , which is called the synagogue of the Libertines , and Cyrenians , and Alexandrians , and of them of Cilicia and of Asia , disputing with Stephen .
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake .
Then they suborned men , which said , We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses , and against God .
And they stirred up the people , and the elders , and the scribes , and came upon him , and caught him , and brought him to the council ,
And set up false witnesses , which said , This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place , and the law :
For we have heard him say , that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place , and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us .
And all that sat in the council , looking stedfastly on him , saw his face as it had been the face of an angel .
Then said the high priest , Are these things so ?
And he said , Men , brethren , and fathers , hearken ; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham , when he was in Mesopotamia , before he dwelt in Charran ,
And said unto him , Get thee out of thy country , and from thy kindred , and come into the land which I shall shew thee .
Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans , and dwelt in Charran : and from thence , when his father was dead , he removed him into this land , wherein ye now dwell .
And he gave him none inheritance in it , no , not so much as to set his foot on : yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession , and to his seed after him , when as yet he had no child .
And God spake on this wise , That his seed should sojourn in a strange land ; and that they should bring them into bondage , and entreat them evil four hundred years .
And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge , said God : and after that shall they come forth , and serve me in this place .
And he gave him the covenant of circumcision : and so Abraham begat Isaac , and circumcised him the eighth day ; and Isaac begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs .
And the patriarchs , moved with envy , sold Joseph into Egypt : but God was with him ,
And delivered him out of all his afflictions , and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt ; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house .
Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan , and great affliction : and our fathers found no sustenance .
But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt , he sent out our fathers first .
And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren ; and Joseph ' s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh .
Then sent Joseph , and called his father Jacob to him , and all his kindred , threescore and fifteen souls .
So Jacob went down into Egypt , and died , he , and our fathers ,
And were carried over into Sychem , and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem .
But when the time of the promise drew nigh , which God had sworn to Abraham , the people grew and multiplied in Egypt ,
Till another king arose , which knew not Joseph .
The same dealt subtilly with our kindred , and evil entreated our fathers , so that they cast out their young children , to the end they might not live .
In which time Moses was born , and was exceeding fair , and nourished up in his father ' s house three months :
And when he was cast out , Pharaoh ' s daughter took him up , and nourished him for her own son .
And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians , and was mighty in words and in deeds .
And when he was full forty years old , it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel .
And seeing one of them suffer wrong , he defended him , and avenged him that was oppressed , and smote the Egyptian :
For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them : but they understood not .
And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove , and would have set them at one again , saying , Sirs , ye are brethren ; why do ye wrong one to another ?
But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us ?
Wilt thou kill me , as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday ?
Then fled Moses at this saying , and was a stranger in the land of Madian , where he begat two sons .
And when forty years were expired , there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush .
When Moses saw it , he wondered at the sight : and as he drew near to behold it , the voice of the LORD came unto him ,
Saying , I am the God of thy fathers , the God of Abraham , and the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . Then Moses trembled , and durst not behold .
Then said the Lord to him , Put off thy shoes from thy feet : for the place where thou standest is holy ground .
I have seen , I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt , and I have heard their groaning , and am come down to deliver them . And now come , I will send thee into Egypt .
This Moses whom they refused , saying , Who made thee a ruler and a judge ? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush .
He brought them out , after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt , and in the Red sea , and in the wilderness forty years .
This is that Moses , which said unto the children of Israel , A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren , like unto me ; him shall ye hear .
This is he , that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina , and with our fathers : who received the lively oracles to give unto us :
To whom our fathers would not obey , but thrust him from them , and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt ,
Saying unto Aaron , Make us gods to go before us : for as for this Moses , which brought us out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him .
And they made a calf in those days , and offered sacrifice unto the idol , and rejoiced in the works of their own hands .
Then God turned , and gave them up to worship the host of heaven ; as it is written in the book of the prophets , O ye house of Israel , have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness ?
Yea , ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch , and the star of your god Remphan , figures which ye made to worship them : and I will carry you away beyond Babylon .
Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness , as he had appointed , speaking unto Moses , that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen .
Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles , whom God drave out before the face of our fathers , unto the days of David ;
Who found favour before God , and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob .
But Solomon built him an house .
Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands ; as saith the prophet ,
Heaven is my throne , and earth is my footstool : what house will ye build me ? saith the Lord : or what is the place of my rest ?
Hath not my hand made all these things ?
Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears , ye do always resist the Holy Ghost : as your fathers did , so do ye .
Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted ? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One ; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers :
Who have received the law by the disposition of angels , and have not kept it .
When they heard these things , they were cut to the heart , and they gnashed on him with their teeth .
But he , being full of the Holy Ghost , looked up stedfastly into heaven , and saw the glory of God , and Jesus standing on the right hand of God ,
And said , Behold , I see the heavens opened , and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God .
Then they cried out with a loud voice , and stopped their ears , and ran upon him with one accord ,
And cast him out of the city , and stoned him : and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man ' s feet , whose name was Saul .
And they stoned Stephen , calling upon God , and saying , Lord Jesus , receive my spirit .
And he kneeled down , and cried with a loud voice , Lord , lay not this sin to their charge . And when he had said this , he fell asleep .
And Saul was consenting unto his death . And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem ; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria , except the apostles .
And devout men carried Stephen to his burial , and made great lamentation over him .
As for Saul , he made havock of the church , entering into every house , and haling men and women committed them to prison .
Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word .
Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria , and preached Christ unto them .
And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake , hearing and seeing the miracles which he did .
For unclean spirits , crying with loud voice , came out of many that were possessed with them : and many taken with palsies , and that were lame , were healed .
And there was great joy in that city .
But there was a certain man , called Simon , which beforetime in the same city used sorcery , and bewitched the people of Samaria , giving out that himself was some great one :
To whom they all gave heed , from the least to the greatest , saying , This man is the great power of God .
And to him they had regard , because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries .
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God , and the name of Jesus Christ , they were baptized , both men and women .
Then Simon himself believed also : and when he was baptized , he continued with Philip , and wondered , beholding the miracles and signs which were done .
Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God , they sent unto them Peter and John :
Who , when they were come down , prayed for them , that they might receive the Holy Ghost :
( For as yet he was fallen upon none of them : only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus . )
Then laid they their hands on them , and they received the Holy Ghost .
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles ' hands the Holy Ghost was given , he offered them money ,
Saying , Give me also this power , that on whomsoever I lay hands , he may receive the Holy Ghost .
But Peter said unto him , Thy money perish with thee , because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money .
Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter : for thy heart is not right in the sight of God .
Repent therefore of this thy wickedness , and pray God , if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee .
For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness , and in the bond of iniquity .
Then answered Simon , and said , Pray ye to the LORD for me , that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me .
And they , when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord , returned to Jerusalem , and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans .
And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip , saying , Arise , and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza , which is desert .
And he arose and went : and , behold , a man of Ethiopia , an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians , who had the charge of all her treasure , and had come to Jerusalem for to worship ,
Was returning , and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet .
Then the Spirit said unto Philip , Go near , and join thyself to this chariot .
And Philip ran thither to him , and heard him read the prophet Esaias , and said , Understandest thou what thou readest ?
And he said , How can I , except some man should guide me ? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him .
The place of the scripture which he read was this , He was led as a sheep to the slaughter ; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer , so opened he not his mouth :
In his humiliation his judgment was taken away : and who shall declare his generation ? for his life is taken from the earth .
And the eunuch answered Philip , and said , I pray thee , of whom speaketh the prophet this ? of himself , or of some other man ?
Then Philip opened his mouth , and began at the same scripture , and preached unto him Jesus .
And as they went on their way , they came unto a certain water : and the eunuch said , See , here is water ; what doth hinder me to be baptized ?
And Philip said , If thou believest with all thine heart , thou mayest . And he answered and said , I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God .
And he commanded the chariot to stand still : and they went down both into the water , both Philip and the eunuch ; and he baptized him .
And when they were come up out of the water , the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip , that the eunuch saw him no more : and he went on his way rejoicing .
But Philip was found at Azotus : and passing through he preached in all the cities , till he came to Caesarea .
And Saul , yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord , went unto the high priest ,
And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues , that if he found any of this way , whether they were men or women , he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem .
And as he journeyed , he came near Damascus : and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven :
And he fell to the earth , and heard a voice saying unto him , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ?
And he said , Who art thou , Lord ? And the Lord said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest : it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
And he trembling and astonished said , Lord , what wilt thou have me to do ? And the Lord said unto him , Arise , and go into the city , and it shall be told thee what thou must do .
And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless , hearing a voice , but seeing no man .
And Saul arose from the earth ; and when his eyes were opened , he saw no man : but they led him by the hand , and brought him into Damascus .
And he was three days without sight , and neither did eat nor drink .
And there was a certain disciple at Damascus , named Ananias ; and to him said the Lord in a vision , Ananias . And he said , Behold , I am here , Lord .
And the Lord said unto him , Arise , and go into the street which is called Straight , and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul , of Tarsus : for , behold , he prayeth ,
And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in , and putting his hand on him , that he might receive his sight .
Then Ananias answered , Lord , I have heard by many of this man , how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem :
And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name .
But the Lord said unto him , Go thy way : for he is a chosen vessel unto me , to bear my name before the Gentiles , and kings , and the children of Israel :
For I will shew him how great things he must suffer for my name ' s sake .
And Ananias went his way , and entered into the house ; and putting his hands on him said , Brother Saul , the Lord , even Jesus , that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest , hath sent me , that thou mightest receive thy sight , and be filled with the Holy Ghost .
And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales : and he received sight forthwith , and arose , and was baptized .
And when he had received meat , he was strengthened . Then was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus .
And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues , that he is the Son of God .
But all that heard him were amazed , and said ; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem , and came hither for that intent , that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests ?
But Saul increased the more in strength , and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus , proving that this is very Christ .
And after that many days were fulfilled , the Jews took counsel to kill him :
But their laying await was known of Saul . And they watched the gates day and night to kill him .
Then the disciples took him by night , and let him down by the wall in a basket .
And when Saul was come to Jerusalem , he assayed to join himself to the disciples : but they were all afraid of him , and believed not that he was a disciple .
But Barnabas took him , and brought him to the apostles , and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way , and that he had spoken to him , and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus .
And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem .
And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus , and disputed against the Grecians : but they went about to slay him .
Which when the brethren knew , they brought him down to Caesarea , and sent him forth to Tarsus .
Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria , and were edified ; and walking in the fear of the Lord , and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost , were multiplied .
And it came to pass , as Peter passed throughout all quarters , he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda .
And there he found a certain man named Aeneas , which had kept his bed eight years , and was sick of the palsy .
And Peter said unto him , Aeneas , Jesus Christ maketh thee whole : arise , and make thy bed . And he arose immediately .
And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him , and turned to the Lord .
Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha , which by interpretation is called Dorcas : this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did .
And it came to pass in those days , that she was sick , and died : whom when they had washed , they laid her in an upper chamber .
And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa , and the disciples had heard that Peter was there , they sent unto him two men , desiring him that he would not delay to come to them .
Then Peter arose and went with them . When he was come , they brought him into the upper chamber : and all the widows stood by him weeping , and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made , while she was with them .
But Peter put them all forth , and kneeled down , and prayed ; and turning him to the body said , Tabitha , arise . And she opened her eyes : and when she saw Peter , she sat up .
And he gave her his hand , and lifted her up , and when he had called the saints and widows , presented her alive .
And it was known throughout all Joppa ; and many believed in the Lord .
And it came to pass , that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner .
There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius , a centurion of the band called the Italian band ,
A devout man , and one that feared God with all his house , which gave much alms to the people , and prayed to God alway .
He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him , and saying unto him , Cornelius .
And when he looked on him , he was afraid , and said , What is it , Lord ? And he said unto him , Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God .
And now send men to Joppa , and call for one Simon , whose surname is Peter :
He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner , whose house is by the sea side : he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do .
And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed , he called two of his household servants , and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually ;
And when he had declared all these things unto them , he sent them to Joppa .
On the morrow , as they went on their journey , and drew nigh unto the city , Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour :
And he became very hungry , and would have eaten : but while they made ready , he fell into a trance ,
And saw heaven opened , and a certain vessel descending upon him , as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners , and let down to the earth :
Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
And there came a voice to him , Rise , Peter ; kill , and eat .
But Peter said , Not so , Lord ; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean .
And the voice spake unto him again the second time , What God hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
This was done thrice : and the vessel was received up again into heaven .
Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean , behold , the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon ' s house , and stood before the gate ,
And called , and asked whether Simon , which was surnamed Peter , were lodged there .
While Peter thought on the vision , the Spirit said unto him , Behold , three men seek thee .
Arise therefore , and get thee down , and go with them , doubting nothing : for I have sent them .
Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius ; and said , Behold , I am he whom ye seek : what is the cause wherefore ye are come ?
And they said , Cornelius the centurion , a just man , and one that feareth God , and of good report among all the nation of the Jews , was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house , and to hear words of thee .
Then called he them in , and lodged them . And on the morrow Peter went away with them , and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him .
And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea . And Cornelius waited for them , and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends .
And as Peter was coming in , Cornelius met him , and fell down at his feet , and worshipped him .
But Peter took him up , saying , Stand up ; I myself also am a man .
And as he talked with him , he went in , and found many that were come together .
And he said unto them , Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company , or come unto one of another nation ; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean .
Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying , as soon as I was sent for : I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me ?
And Cornelius said , Four days ago I was fasting until this hour ; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house , and , behold , a man stood before me in bright clothing ,
And said , Cornelius , thy prayer is heard , and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God .
Send therefore to Joppa , and call hither Simon , whose surname is Peter ; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side : who , when he cometh , shall speak unto thee .
Immediately therefore I sent to thee ; and thou hast well done that thou art come . Now therefore are we all here present before God , to hear all things that are commanded thee of God .
Then Peter opened his mouth , and said , Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons :
But in every nation he that feareth him , and worketh righteousness , is accepted with him .
The word which God sent unto the children of Israel , preaching peace by Jesus Christ : ( he is Lord of all : )
That word , I say , ye know , which was published throughout all Judaea , and began from Galilee , after the baptism which John preached ;
How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power : who went about doing good , and healing all that were oppressed of the devil ; for God was with him .
And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews , and in Jerusalem ; whom they slew and hanged on a tree :
Him God raised up the third day , and shewed him openly ;
Not to all the people , but unto witnesses chosen before God , even to us , who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead .
And he commanded us to preach unto the people , and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead .
To him give all the prophets witness , that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins .
While Peter yet spake these words , the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word .
And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished , as many as came with Peter , because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost .
For they heard them speak with tongues , and magnify God . Then answered Peter ,
Can any man forbid water , that these should not be baptized , which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we ?
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord . Then prayed they him to tarry certain days .
And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God .
And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem , they that were of the circumcision contended with him ,
Saying , Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised , and didst eat with them .
But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning , and expounded it by order unto them , saying ,
I was in the city of Joppa praying : and in a trance I saw a vision , A certain vessel descend , as it had been a great sheet , let down from heaven by four corners ; and it came even to me :
Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes , I considered , and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth , and wild beasts , and creeping things , and fowls of the air .
And I heard a voice saying unto me , Arise , Peter ; slay and eat .
But I said , Not so , Lord : for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth .
But the voice answered me again from heaven , What God hath cleansed , that call not thou common .
And this was done three times : and all were drawn up again into heaven .
And , behold , immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was , sent from Caesarea unto me .
And the Spirit bade me go with them , nothing doubting . Moreover these six brethren accompanied me , and we entered into the man ' s house :
And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house , which stood and said unto him , Send men to Joppa , and call for Simon , whose surname is Peter ;
Who shall tell thee words , whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved .
And as I began to speak , the Holy Ghost fell on them , as on us at the beginning .
Then remembered I the word of the Lord , how that he said , John indeed baptized with water ; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost .
Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us , who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ ; what was I , that I could withstand God ?
When they heard these things , they held their peace , and glorified God , saying , Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life .
Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice , and Cyprus , and Antioch , preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only .
And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene , which , when they were come to Antioch , spake unto the Grecians , preaching the LORD Jesus .
And the hand of the Lord was with them : and a great number believed , and turned unto the Lord .
Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem : and they sent forth Barnabas , that he should go as far as Antioch .
Who , when he came , and had seen the grace of God , was glad , and exhorted them all , that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord .
For he was a good man , and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith : and much people was added unto the Lord .
Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus , for to seek Saul :
And when he had found him , he brought him unto Antioch . And it came to pass , that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church , and taught much people . And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch .
And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch .
And there stood up one of them named Agabus , and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world : which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar .
Then the disciples , every man according to his ability , determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea :
Which also they did , and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul .
Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church .
And he killed James the brother of John with the sword .
And because he saw it pleased the Jews , he proceeded further to take Peter also . ( Then were the days of unleavened bread . )
And when he had apprehended him , he put him in prison , and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him ; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people .
Peter therefore was kept in prison : but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him .
And when Herod would have brought him forth , the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers , bound with two chains : and the keepers before the door kept the prison .
And , behold , the angel of the Lord came upon him , and a light shined in the prison : and he smote Peter on the side , and raised him up , saying , Arise up quickly . And his chains fell off from his hands .
And the angel said unto him , Gird thyself , and bind on thy sandals . And so he did . And he saith unto him , Cast thy garment about thee , and follow me .
And he went out , and followed him ; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel ; but thought he saw a vision .
When they were past the first and the second ward , they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city ; which opened to them of his own accord : and they went out , and passed on through one street ; and forthwith the angel departed from him .
And when Peter was come to himself , he said , Now I know of a surety , that the LORD hath sent his angel , and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod , and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews .
And when he had considered the thing , he came to the house of Mary the mother of John , whose surname was Mark ; where many were gathered together praying .
And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate , a damsel came to hearken , named Rhoda .
And when she knew Peter ' s voice , she opened not the gate for gladness , but ran in , and told how Peter stood before the gate .
And they said unto her , Thou art mad . But she constantly affirmed that it was even so . Then said they , It is his angel .
But Peter continued knocking : and when they had opened the door , and saw him , they were astonished .
But he , beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace , declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison . And he said , Go shew these things unto James , and to the brethren . And he departed , and went into another place .
Now as soon as it was day , there was no small stir among the soldiers , what was become of Peter .
And when Herod had sought for him , and found him not , he examined the keepers , and commanded that they should be put to death . And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea , and there abode .
And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon : but they came with one accord to him , and , having made Blastus the king ' s chamberlain their friend , desired peace ; because their country was nourished by the king ' s country .
And upon a set day Herod , arrayed in royal apparel , sat upon his throne , and made an oration unto them .
And the people gave a shout , saying , It is the voice of a god , and not of a man .
And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him , because he gave not God the glory : and he was eaten of worms , and gave up the ghost .
But the word of God grew and multiplied .
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem , when they had fulfilled their ministry , and took with them John , whose surname was Mark .
Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas , and Simeon that was called Niger , and Lucius of Cyrene , and Manaen , which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch , and Saul .
As they ministered to the Lord , and fasted , the Holy Ghost said , Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them .
And when they had fasted and prayed , and laid their hands on them , they sent them away .
So they , being sent forth by the Holy Ghost , departed unto Seleucia ; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus .
And when they were at Salamis , they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews : and they had also John to their minister .
And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos , they found a certain sorcerer , a false prophet , a Jew , whose name was Barjesus :
Which was with the deputy of the country , Sergius Paulus , a prudent man ; who called for Barnabas and Saul , and desired to hear the word of God .
But Elymas the sorcerer ( for so is his name by interpretation ) withstood them , seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith .
Then Saul , ( who also is called Paul , ) filled with the Holy Ghost , set his eyes on him .
And said , O full of all subtilty and all mischief , thou child of the devil , thou enemy of all righteousness , wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord ?
And now , behold , the hand of the Lord is upon thee , and thou shalt be blind , not seeing the sun for a season . And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness ; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand .
Then the deputy , when he saw what was done , believed , being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord .
Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos , they came to Perga in Pamphylia : and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem .
But when they departed from Perga , they came to Antioch in Pisidia , and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day , and sat down .
And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them , saying , Ye men and brethren , if ye have any word of exhortation for the people , say on .
Then Paul stood up , and beckoning with his hand said , Men of Israel , and ye that fear God , give audience .
The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers , and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt , and with an high arm brought he them out of it .
And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness .
And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan , he divided their land to them by lot .
And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years , until Samuel the prophet .
And afterward they desired a king : and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis , a man of the tribe of Benjamin , by the space of forty years .
And when he had removed him , he raised up unto them David to be their king ; to whom also he gave their testimony , and said , I have found David the son of Jesse , a man after mine own heart , which shall fulfil all my will .
Of this man ' s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto Israel a Saviour , Jesus :
When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel .
And as John fulfilled his course , he said , Whom think ye that I am ? I am not he . But , behold , there cometh one after me , whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose .
Men and brethren , children of the stock of Abraham , and whosoever among you feareth God , to you is the word of this salvation sent .
For they that dwell at Jerusalem , and their rulers , because they knew him not , nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day , they have fulfilled them in condemning him .
And though they found no cause of death in him , yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain .
And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him , they took him down from the tree , and laid him in a sepulchre .
But God raised him from the dead :
And he was seen many days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem , who are his witnesses unto the people .
And we declare unto you glad tidings , how that the promise which was made unto the fathers ,
God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children , in that he hath raised up Jesus again ; as it is also written in the second psalm , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee .
And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead , now no more to return to corruption , he said on this wise , I will give you the sure mercies of David .
Wherefore he saith also in another psalm , Thou shalt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption .
For David , after he had served his own generation by the will of God , fell on sleep , and was laid unto his fathers , and saw corruption :
But he , whom God raised again , saw no corruption .
Be it known unto you therefore , men and brethren , that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins :
And by him all that believe are justified from all things , from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses .
Beware therefore , lest that come upon you , which is spoken of in the prophets ;
Behold , ye despisers , and wonder , and perish : for I work a work in your days , a work which ye shall in no wise believe , though a man declare it unto you .
And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue , the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath .
Now when the congregation was broken up , many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas : who , speaking to them , persuaded them to continue in the grace of God .
And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God .
But when the Jews saw the multitudes , they were filled with envy , and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul , contradicting and blaspheming .
Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold , and said , It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you : but seeing ye put it from you , and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life , lo , we turn to the Gentiles .
For so hath the Lord commanded us , saying , I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles , that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth .
And when the Gentiles heard this , they were glad , and glorified the word of the Lord : and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed .
And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region .
But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women , and the chief men of the city , and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas , and expelled them out of their coasts .
But they shook off the dust of their feet against them , and came unto Iconium .
And the disciples were filled with joy , and with the Holy Ghost .
And it came to pass in Iconium , that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews , and so spake , that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed .
But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles , and made their minds evil affected against the brethren .
Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord , which gave testimony unto the word of his grace , and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands .
But the multitude of the city was divided : and part held with the Jews , and part with the apostles .
And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles , and also of the Jews with their rulers , to use them despitefully , and to stone them ,
They were ware of it , and fled unto Lystra and Derbe , cities of Lycaonia , and unto the region that lieth round about :
And there they preached the gospel .
And there sat a certain man at Lystra , impotent in his feet , being a cripple from his mother ' s womb , who never had walked :
The same heard Paul speak : who stedfastly beholding him , and perceiving that he had faith to be healed ,
Said with a loud voice , Stand upright on thy feet . And he leaped and walked .
And when the people saw what Paul had done , they lifted up their voices , saying in the speech of Lycaonia , The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men .
And they called Barnabas , Jupiter ; and Paul , Mercurius , because he was the chief speaker .
Then the priest of Jupiter , which was before their city , brought oxen and garlands unto the gates , and would have done sacrifice with the people .
Which when the apostles , Barnabas and Paul , heard of , they rent their clothes , and ran in among the people , crying out ,
And saying , Sirs , why do ye these things ? We also are men of like passions with you , and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God , which made heaven , and earth , and the sea , and all things that are therein :
Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways .
Nevertheless he left not himself without witness , in that he did good , and gave us rain from heaven , and fruitful seasons , filling our hearts with food and gladness .
And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people , that they had not done sacrifice unto them .
And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium , who persuaded the people , and having stoned Paul , drew him out of the city , supposing he had been dead .
Howbeit , as the disciples stood round about him , he rose up , and came into the city : and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe .
And when they had preached the gospel to that city , and had taught many , they returned again to Lystra , and to Iconium , and Antioch ,
Confirming the souls of the disciples , and exhorting them to continue in the faith , and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God .
And when they had ordained them elders in every church , and had prayed with fasting , they commended them to the Lord , on whom they believed .
And after they had passed throughout Pisidia , they came to Pamphylia .
And when they had preached the word in Perga , they went down into Attalia :
And thence sailed to Antioch , from whence they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled .
And when they were come , and had gathered the church together , they rehearsed all that God had done with them , and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles .
And there they abode long time with the disciples .
And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren , and said , Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses , ye cannot be saved .
When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them , they determined that Paul and Barnabas , and certain other of them , should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question .
And being brought on their way by the church , they passed through Phenice and Samaria , declaring the conversion of the Gentiles : and they caused great joy unto all the brethren .
And when they were come to Jerusalem , they were received of the church , and of the apostles and elders , and they declared all things that God had done with them .
But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed , saying , That it was needful to circumcise them , and to command them to keep the law of Moses .
And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter .
And when there had been much disputing , Peter rose up , and said unto them , Men and brethren , ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us , that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel , and believe .
And God , which knoweth the hearts , bare them witness , giving them the Holy Ghost , even as he did unto us ;
And put no difference between us and them , purifying their hearts by faith .
Now therefore why tempt ye God , to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples , which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear ?
But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved , even as they .
Then all the multitude kept silence , and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul , declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them .
And after they had held their peace , James answered , saying , Men and brethren , hearken unto me :
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles , to take out of them a people for his name .
And to this agree the words of the prophets ; as it is written ,
After this I will return , and will build again the tabernacle of David , which is fallen down ; and I will build again the ruins thereof , and I will set it up :
That the residue of men might seek after the Lord , and all the Gentiles , upon whom my name is called , saith the Lord , who doeth all these things .
Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world .
Wherefore my sentence is , that we trouble not them , which from among the Gentiles are turned to God :
But that we write unto them , that they abstain from pollutions of idols , and from fornication , and from things strangled , and from blood .
For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him , being read in the synagogues every sabbath day .
Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church , to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas ; namely , Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas , chief men among the brethren :
And they wrote letters by them after this manner ; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia .
Forasmuch as we have heard , that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words , subverting your souls , saying , Ye must be circumcised , and keep the law : to whom we gave no such commandment :
It seemed good unto us , being assembled with one accord , to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul ,
Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ .
We have sent therefore Judas and Silas , who shall also tell you the same things by mouth .
For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost , and to us , to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things ;
That ye abstain from meats offered to idols , and from blood , and from things strangled , and from fornication : from which if ye keep yourselves , ye shall do well . Fare ye well .
So when they were dismissed , they came to Antioch : and when they had gathered the multitude together , they delivered the epistle :
Which when they had read , they rejoiced for the consolation .
And Judas and Silas , being prophets also themselves , exhorted the brethren with many words , and confirmed them .
And after they had tarried there a space , they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles .
Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still .
Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch , teaching and preaching the word of the Lord , with many others also .
And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas , Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD , and see how they do .
And Barnabas determined to take with them John , whose surname was Mark .
But Paul thought not good to take him with them , who departed from them from Pamphylia , and went not with them to the work .
And the contention was so sharp between them , that they departed asunder one from the other : and so Barnabas took Mark , and sailed unto Cyprus ;
And Paul chose Silas , and departed , being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God .
And he went through Syria and Cilicia , confirming the churches .
Then came he to Derbe and Lystra : and , behold , a certain disciple was there , named Timotheus , the son of a certain woman , which was a Jewess , and believed ; but his father was a Greek :
Which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium .
Him would Paul have to go forth with him ; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters : for they knew all that his father was a Greek .
And as they went through the cities , they delivered them the decrees for to keep , that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem .
And so were the churches established in the faith , and increased in number daily .
Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia , and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia ,
After they were come to Mysia , they assayed to go into Bithynia : but the Spirit suffered them not .
And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas .
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night ; There stood a man of Macedonia , and prayed him , saying , Come over into Macedonia , and help us .
And after he had seen the vision , immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia , assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them .
Therefore loosing from Troas , we came with a straight course to Samothracia , and the next day to Neapolis ;
And from thence to Philippi , which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia , and a colony : and we were in that city abiding certain days .
And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side , where prayer was wont to be made ; and we sat down , and spake unto the women which resorted thither .
And a certain woman named Lydia , a seller of purple , of the city of Thyatira , which worshipped God , heard us : whose heart the Lord opened , that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul .
And when she was baptized , and her household , she besought us , saying , If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord , come into my house , and abide there . And she constrained us .
And it came to pass , as we went to prayer , a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us , which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying :
The same followed Paul and us , and cried , saying , These men are the servants of the most high God , which shew unto us the way of salvation .
And this did she many days . But Paul , being grieved , turned and said to the spirit , I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her . And he came out the same hour .
And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone , they caught Paul and Silas , and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers ,
And brought them to the magistrates , saying , These men , being Jews , do exceedingly trouble our city ,
And teach customs , which are not lawful for us to receive , neither to observe , being Romans .
And the multitude rose up together against them : and the magistrates rent off their clothes , and commanded to beat them .
And when they had laid many stripes upon them , they cast them into prison , charging the jailor to keep them safely :
Who , having received such a charge , thrust them into the inner prison , and made their feet fast in the stocks .
And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed , and sang praises unto God : and the prisoners heard them .
And suddenly there was a great earthquake , so that the foundations of the prison were shaken : and immediately all the doors were opened , and every one ' s bands were loosed .
And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep , and seeing the prison doors open , he drew out his sword , and would have killed himself , supposing that the prisoners had been fled .
But Paul cried with a loud voice , saying , Do thyself no harm : for we are all here .
Then he called for a light , and sprang in , and came trembling , and fell down before Paul and Silas ,
And brought them out , and said , Sirs , what must I do to be saved ?
And they said , Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ , and thou shalt be saved , and thy house .
And they spake unto him the word of the Lord , and to all that were in his house .
And he took them the same hour of the night , and washed their stripes ; and was baptized , he and all his , straightway .
And when he had brought them into his house , he set meat before them , and rejoiced , believing in God with all his house .
And when it was day , the magistrates sent the serjeants , saying , Let those men go .
And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul , The magistrates have sent to let you go : now therefore depart , and go in peace .
But Paul said unto them , They have beaten us openly uncondemned , being Romans , and have cast us into prison ; and now do they thrust us out privily ? nay verily ; but let them come themselves and fetch us out .
And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates : and they feared , when they heard that they were Romans .
And they came and besought them , and brought them out , and desired them to depart out of the city .
And they went out of the prison , and entered into the house of Lydia : and when they had seen the brethren , they comforted them , and departed .
Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia , they came to Thessalonica , where was a synagogue of the Jews :
And Paul , as his manner was , went in unto them , and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures ,
Opening and alleging , that Christ must needs have suffered , and risen again from the dead ; and that this Jesus , whom I preach unto you , is Christ .
And some of them believed , and consorted with Paul and Silas ; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude , and of the chief women not a few .
But the Jews which believed not , moved with envy , took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort , and gathered a company , and set all the city on an uproar , and assaulted the house of Jason , and sought to bring them out to the people .
And when they found them not , they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city , crying , These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also ;
Whom Jason hath received : and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar , saying that there is another king , one Jesus .
And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city , when they heard these things .
And when they had taken security of Jason , and of the other , they let them go .
And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea : who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews .
These were more noble than those in Thessalonica , in that they received the word with all readiness of mind , and searched the scriptures daily , whether those things were so .
Therefore many of them believed ; also of honourable women which were Greeks , and of men , not a few .
But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea , they came thither also , and stirred up the people .
And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea : but Silas and Timotheus abode there still .
And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens : and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed , they departed .
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens , his spirit was stirred in him , when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry .
Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews , and with the devout persons , and in the market daily with them that met with him .
Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans , and of the Stoicks , encountered him . And some said , What will this babbler say ? other some , He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods : because he preached unto them Jesus , and the resurrection .
And they took him , and brought him unto Areopagus , saying , May we know what this new doctrine , whereof thou speakest , is ?
For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears : we would know therefore what these things mean .
( For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else , but either to tell , or to hear some new thing . )
Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars ' hill , and said , Ye men of Athens , I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious .
For as I passed by , and beheld your devotions , I found an altar with this inscription , TO THE UNKNOWN GOD . Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship , him declare I unto you .
God that made the world and all things therein , seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth , dwelleth not in temples made with hands ;
Neither is worshipped with men ' s hands , as though he needed any thing , seeing he giveth to all life , and breath , and all things ;
And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth , and hath determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation ;
That they should seek the Lord , if haply they might feel after him , and find him , though he be not far from every one of us :
For in him we live , and move , and have our being ; as certain also of your own poets have said , For we are also his offspring .
Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God , we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold , or silver , or stone , graven by art and man ' s device .
And the times of this ignorance God winked at ; but now commandeth all men every where to repent :
Because he hath appointed a day , in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained ; whereof he hath given assurance unto all men , in that he hath raised him from the dead .
And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead , some mocked : and others said , We will hear thee again of this matter .
So Paul departed from among them .
Howbeit certain men clave unto him , and believed : among the which was Dionysius the Areopagite , and a woman named Damaris , and others with them .
After these things Paul departed from Athens , and came to Corinth ;
And found a certain Jew named Aquila , born in Pontus , lately come from Italy , with his wife Priscilla ; ( because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome : ) and came unto them .
And because he was of the same craft , he abode with them , and wrought : for by their occupation they were tentmakers .
And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath , and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks .
And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia , Paul was pressed in the spirit , and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ .
And when they opposed themselves , and blasphemed , he shook his raiment , and said unto them , Your blood be upon your own heads ; I am clean ; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles .
And he departed thence , and entered into a certain man ' s house , named Justus , one that worshipped God , whose house joined hard to the synagogue .
And Crispus , the chief ruler of the synagogue , believed on the Lord with all his house ; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed , and were baptized .
Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision , Be not afraid , but speak , and hold not thy peace :
For I am with thee , and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee : for I have much people in this city .
And he continued there a year and six months , teaching the word of God among them .
And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia , the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul , and brought him to the judgment seat ,
Saying , This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law .
And when Paul was now about to open his mouth , Gallio said unto the Jews , If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness , O ye Jews , reason would that I should bear with you :
But if it be a question of words and names , and of your law , look ye to it ; for I will be no judge of such matters .
And he drave them from the judgment seat .
Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes , the chief ruler of the synagogue , and beat him before the judgment seat . And Gallio cared for none of those things .
And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while , and then took his leave of the brethren , and sailed thence into Syria , and with him Priscilla and Aquila ; having shorn his head in Cenchrea : for he had a vow .
And he came to Ephesus , and left them there : but he himself entered into the synagogue , and reasoned with the Jews .
When they desired him to tarry longer time with them , he consented not ;
But bade them farewell , saying , I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem : but I will return again unto you , if God will . And he sailed from Ephesus .
And when he had landed at Caesarea , and gone up , and saluted the church , he went down to Antioch .
And after he had spent some time there , he departed , and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order , strengthening all the disciples .
And a certain Jew named Apollos , born at Alexandria , an eloquent man , and mighty in the scriptures , came to Ephesus .
This man was instructed in the way of the Lord ; and being fervent in the spirit , he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord , knowing only the baptism of John .
And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue : whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard , they took him unto them , and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly .
And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia , the brethren wrote , exhorting the disciples to receive him : who , when he was come , helped them much which had believed through grace :
For he mightily convinced the Jews , and that publickly , shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ .
And it came to pass , that , while Apollos was at Corinth , Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus : and finding certain disciples ,
He said unto them , Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed ? And they said unto him , We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost .
And he said unto them , Unto what then were ye baptized ? And they said , Unto John ' s baptism .
Then said Paul , John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance , saying unto the people , that they should believe on him which should come after him , that is , on Christ Jesus .
When they heard this , they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus .
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them , the Holy Ghost came on them ; and they spake with tongues , and prophesied .
And all the men were about twelve .
And he went into the synagogue , and spake boldly for the space of three months , disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God .
But when divers were hardened , and believed not , but spake evil of that way before the multitude , he departed from them , and separated the disciples , disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus .
And this continued by the space of two years ; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus , both Jews and Greeks .
And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul :
So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons , and the diseases departed from them , and the evil spirits went out of them .
Then certain of the vagabond Jews , exorcists , took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus , saying , We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth .
And there were seven sons of one Sceva , a Jew , and chief of the priests , which did so .
And the evil spirit answered and said , Jesus I know , and Paul I know ; but who are ye ?
And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them , and overcame them , and prevailed against them , so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded .
And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus ; and fear fell on them all , and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified .
And many that believed came , and confessed , and shewed their deeds .
Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together , and burned them before all men : and they counted the price of them , and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver .
So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed .
After these things were ended , Paul purposed in the spirit , when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia , to go to Jerusalem , saying , After I have been there , I must also see Rome .
So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him , Timotheus and Erastus ; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season .
And the same time there arose no small stir about that way .
For a certain man named Demetrius , a silversmith , which made silver shrines for Diana , brought no small gain unto the craftsmen ;
Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation , and said , Sirs , ye know that by this craft we have our wealth .
Moreover ye see and hear , that not alone at Ephesus , but almost throughout all Asia , this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people , saying that they be no gods , which are made with hands :
So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought ; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised , and her magnificence should be destroyed , whom all Asia and the world worshippeth .
And when they heard these sayings , they were full of wrath , and cried out , saying , Great is Diana of the Ephesians .
And the whole city was filled with confusion : and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus , men of Macedonia , Paul ' s companions in travel , they rushed with one accord into the theatre .
And when Paul would have entered in unto the people , the disciples suffered him not .
And certain of the chief of Asia , which were his friends , sent unto him , desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre .
Some therefore cried one thing , and some another : for the assembly was confused : and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together .
And they drew Alexander out of the multitude , the Jews putting him forward . And Alexander beckoned with the hand , and would have made his defence unto the people .
But when they knew that he was a Jew , all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out , Great is Diana of the Ephesians .
And when the townclerk had appeased the people , he said , Ye men of Ephesus , what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana , and of the image which fell down from Jupiter ?
Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against , ye ought to be quiet , and to do nothing rashly .
For ye have brought hither these men , which are neither robbers of churches , nor yet blasphemers of your goddess .
Wherefore if Demetrius , and the craftsmen which are with him , have a matter against any man , the law is open , and there are deputies : let them implead one another .
But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters , it shall be determined in a lawful assembly .
For we are in danger to be called in question for this day ' s uproar , there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse .
And when he had thus spoken , he dismissed the assembly .
And after the uproar was ceased , Paul called unto him the disciples , and embraced them , and departed for to go into Macedonia .
And when he had gone over those parts , and had given them much exhortation , he came into Greece ,
And there abode three months . And when the Jews laid wait for him , as he was about to sail into Syria , he purposed to return through Macedonia .
And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea ; and of the Thessalonians , Aristarchus and Secundus ; and Gaius of Derbe , and Timotheus ; and of Asia , Tychicus and Trophimus .
These going before tarried for us at Troas .
And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread , and came unto them to Troas in five days ; where we abode seven days .
And upon the first day of the week , when the disciples came together to break bread , Paul preached unto them , ready to depart on the morrow ; and continued his speech until midnight .
And there were many lights in the upper chamber , where they were gathered together .
And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus , being fallen into a deep sleep : and as Paul was long preaching , he sunk down with sleep , and fell down from the third loft , and was taken up dead .
And Paul went down , and fell on him , and embracing him said , Trouble not yourselves ; for his life is in him .
When he therefore was come up again , and had broken bread , and eaten , and talked a long while , even till break of day , so he departed .
And they brought the young man alive , and were not a little comforted .
And we went before to ship , and sailed unto Assos , there intending to take in Paul : for so had he appointed , minding himself to go afoot .
And when he met with us at Assos , we took him in , and came to Mitylene .
And we sailed thence , and came the next day over against Chios ; and the next day we arrived at Samos , and tarried at Trogyllium ; and the next day we came to Miletus .
For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus , because he would not spend the time in Asia : for he hasted , if it were possible for him , to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost .
And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus , and called the elders of the church .
And when they were come to him , he said unto them , Ye know , from the first day that I came into Asia , after what manner I have been with you at all seasons ,
Serving the LORD with all humility of mind , and with many tears , and temptations , which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews :
And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you , but have shewed you , and have taught you publickly , and from house to house ,
Testifying both to the Jews , and also to the Greeks , repentance toward God , and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ .
And now , behold , I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem , not knowing the things that shall befall me there :
Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city , saying that bonds and afflictions abide me .
But none of these things move me , neither count I my life dear unto myself , so that I might finish my course with joy , and the ministry , which I have received of the Lord Jesus , to testify the gospel of the grace of God .
And now , behold , I know that ye all , among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God , shall see my face no more .
Wherefore I take you to record this day , that I am pure from the blood of all men .
For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God .
Take heed therefore unto yourselves , and to all the flock , over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers , to feed the church of God , which he hath purchased with his own blood .
For I know this , that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you , not sparing the flock .
Also of your own selves shall men arise , speaking perverse things , to draw away disciples after them .
Therefore watch , and remember , that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears .
And now , brethren , I commend you to God , and to the word of his grace , which is able to build you up , and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified .
I have coveted no man ' s silver , or gold , or apparel .
Yea , ye yourselves know , that these hands have ministered unto my necessities , and to them that were with me .
I have shewed you all things , how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak , and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus , how he said , It is more blessed to give than to receive .
And when he had thus spoken , he kneeled down , and prayed with them all .
And they all wept sore , and fell on Paul ' s neck , and kissed him ,
Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake , that they should see his face no more . And they accompanied him unto the ship .
And it came to pass , that after we were gotten from them , and had launched , we came with a straight course unto Coos , and the day following unto Rhodes , and from thence unto Patara :
And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia , we went aboard , and set forth .
Now when we had discovered Cyprus , we left it on the left hand , and sailed into Syria , and landed at Tyre : for there the ship was to unlade her burden .
And finding disciples , we tarried there seven days : who said to Paul through the Spirit , that he should not go up to Jerusalem .
And when we had accomplished those days , we departed and went our way ; and they all brought us on our way , with wives and children , till we were out of the city : and we kneeled down on the shore , and prayed .
And when we had taken our leave one of another , we took ship ; and they returned home again .
And when we had finished our course from Tyre , we came to Ptolemais , and saluted the brethren , and abode with them one day .
And the next day we that were of Paul ' s company departed , and came unto Caesarea : and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist , which was one of the seven ; and abode with him .
And the same man had four daughters , virgins , which did prophesy .
And as we tarried there many days , there came down from Judaea a certain prophet , named Agabus .
And when he was come unto us , he took Paul ' s girdle , and bound his own hands and feet , and said , Thus saith the Holy Ghost , So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle , and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles .
And when we heard these things , both we , and they of that place , besought him not to go up to Jerusalem .
Then Paul answered , What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart ? for I am ready not to be bound only , but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus .
And when he would not be persuaded , we ceased , saying , The will of the Lord be done .
And after those days we took up our carriages , and went up to Jerusalem .
There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea , and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus , an old disciple , with whom we should lodge .
And when we were come to Jerusalem , the brethren received us gladly .
And the day following Paul went in with us unto James ; and all the elders were present .
And when he had saluted them , he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry .
And when they heard it , they glorified the Lord , and said unto him , Thou seest , brother , how many thousands of Jews there are which believe ; and they are all zealous of the law :
And they are informed of thee , that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses , saying that they ought not to circumcise their children , neither to walk after the customs .
What is it therefore ? the multitude must needs come together : for they will hear that thou art come .
Do therefore this that we say to thee : We have four men which have a vow on them ;
Them take , and purify thyself with them , and be at charges with them , that they may shave their heads : and all may know that those things , whereof they were informed concerning thee , are nothing ; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly , and keepest the law .
As touching the Gentiles which believe , we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing , save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols , and from blood , and from strangled , and from fornication .
Then Paul took the men , and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple , to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification , until that an offering should be offered for every one of them .
And when the seven days were almost ended , the Jews which were of Asia , when they saw him in the temple , stirred up all the people , and laid hands on him ,
Crying out , Men of Israel , help : This is the man , that teacheth all men every where against the people , and the law , and this place : and further brought Greeks also into the temple , and hath polluted this holy place .
( For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian , whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple . )
And all the city was moved , and the people ran together : and they took Paul , and drew him out of the temple : and forthwith the doors were shut .
And as they went about to kill him , tidings came unto the chief captain of the band , that all Jerusalem was in an uproar .
Who immediately took soldiers and centurions , and ran down unto them : and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers , they left beating of Paul .
Then the chief captain came near , and took him , and commanded him to be bound with two chains ; and demanded who he was , and what he had done .
And some cried one thing , some another , among the multitude : and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult , he commanded him to be carried into the castle .
And when he came upon the stairs , so it was , that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people .
For the multitude of the people followed after , crying , Away with him .
And as Paul was to be led into the castle , he said unto the chief captain , May I speak unto thee ? Who said , Canst thou speak Greek ?
Art not thou that Egyptian , which before these days madest an uproar , and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers ?
But Paul said , I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus , a city in Cilicia , a citizen of no mean city : and , I beseech thee , suffer me to speak unto the people .
And when he had given him licence , Paul stood on the stairs , and beckoned with the hand unto the people . And when there was made a great silence , he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue , saying ,
Men , brethren , and fathers , hear ye my defence which I make now unto you .
( And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them , they kept the more silence : and he saith , )
I am verily a man which am a Jew , born in Tarsus , a city in Cilicia , yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel , and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers , and was zealous toward God , as ye all are this day .
And I persecuted this way unto the death , binding and delivering into prisons both men and women .
As also the high priest doth bear me witness , and all the estate of the elders : from whom also I received letters unto the brethren , and went to Damascus , to bring them which were there bound unto Jerusalem , for to be punished .
And it came to pass , that , as I made my journey , and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon , suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me .
And I fell unto the ground , and heard a voice saying unto me , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ?
And I answered , Who art thou , Lord ? And he said unto me , I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom thou persecutest .
And they that were with me saw indeed the light , and were afraid ; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me .
And I said , What shall I do , LORD ? And the Lord said unto me , Arise , and go into Damascus ; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do .
And when I could not see for the glory of that light , being led by the hand of them that were with me , I came into Damascus .
And one Ananias , a devout man according to the law , having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there ,
Came unto me , and stood , and said unto me , Brother Saul , receive thy sight . And the same hour I looked up upon him .
And he said , The God of our fathers hath chosen thee , that thou shouldest know his will , and see that Just One , and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth .
For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard .
And now why tarriest thou ? arise , and be baptized , and wash away thy sins , calling on the name of the Lord .
And it came to pass , that , when I was come again to Jerusalem , even while I prayed in the temple , I was in a trance ;
And saw him saying unto me , Make haste , and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem : for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me .
And I said , Lord , they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee :
And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed , I also was standing by , and consenting unto his death , and kept the raiment of them that slew him .
And he said unto me , Depart : for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles .
And they gave him audience unto this word , and then lifted up their voices , and said , Away with such a fellow from the earth : for it is not fit that he should live .
And as they cried out , and cast off their clothes , and threw dust into the air ,
The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle , and bade that he should be examined by scourging ; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him .
And as they bound him with thongs , Paul said unto the centurion that stood by , Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman , and uncondemned ?
When the centurion heard that , he went and told the chief captain , saying , Take heed what thou doest : for this man is a Roman .
Then the chief captain came , and said unto him , Tell me , art thou a Roman ? He said , Yea .
And the chief captain answered , With a great sum obtained I this freedom . And Paul said , But I was free born .
Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him : and the chief captain also was afraid , after he knew that he was a Roman , and because he had bound him .
On the morrow , because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews , he loosed him from his bands , and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear , and brought Paul down , and set him before them .
And Paul , earnestly beholding the council , said , Men and brethren , I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day .
And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth .
Then said Paul unto him , God shall smite thee , thou whited wall : for sittest thou to judge me after the law , and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law ?
And they that stood by said , Revilest thou God ' s high priest ?
Then said Paul , I wist not , brethren , that he was the high priest : for it is written , Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people .
But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees , and the other Pharisees , he cried out in the council , Men and brethren , I am a Pharisee , the son of a Pharisee : of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question .
And when he had so said , there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees : and the multitude was divided .
For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection , neither angel , nor spirit : but the Pharisees confess both .
And there arose a great cry : and the scribes that were of the Pharisees ' part arose , and strove , saying , We find no evil in this man : but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him , let us not fight against God .
And when there arose a great dissension , the chief captain , fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them , commanded the soldiers to go down , and to take him by force from among them , and to bring him into the castle .
And the night following the Lord stood by him , and said , Be of good cheer , Paul : for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem , so must thou bear witness also at Rome .
And when it was day , certain of the Jews banded together , and bound themselves under a curse , saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul .
And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy .
And they came to the chief priests and elders , and said , We have bound ourselves under a great curse , that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul .
Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow , as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him : and we , or ever he come near , are ready to kill him .
And when Paul ' s sister ' s son heard of their lying in wait , he went and entered into the castle , and told Paul .
Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him , and said , Bring this young man unto the chief captain : for he hath a certain thing to tell him .
So he took him , and brought him to the chief captain , and said , Paul the prisoner called me unto him , and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee , who hath something to say unto thee .
Then the chief captain took him by the hand , and went with him aside privately , and asked him , What is that thou hast to tell me ?
And he said , The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council , as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly .
But do not thou yield unto them : for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men , which have bound themselves with an oath , that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him : and now are they ready , looking for a promise from thee .
So the chief captain then let the young man depart , and charged him , See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me .
And he called unto him two centurions , saying , Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea , and horsemen threescore and ten , and spearmen two hundred , at the third hour of the night ;
And provide them beasts , that they may set Paul on , and bring him safe unto Felix the governor .
And he wrote a letter after this manner :
Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting .
This man was taken of the Jews , and should have been killed of them : then came I with an army , and rescued him , having understood that he was a Roman .
And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him , I brought him forth into their council :
Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law , but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds .
And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man , I sent straightway to thee , and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him . Farewell .
Then the soldiers , as it was commanded them , took Paul , and brought him by night to Antipatris .
On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him , and returned to the castle :
Who , when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor , presented Paul also before him .
And when the governor had read the letter , he asked of what province he was . And when he understood that he was of Cilicia ;
I will hear thee , said he , when thine accusers are also come . And he commanded him to be kept in Herod ' s judgment hall .
And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders , and with a certain orator named Tertullus , who informed the governor against Paul .
And when he was called forth , Tertullus began to accuse him , saying , Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness , and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence ,
We accept it always , and in all places , most noble Felix , with all thankfulness .
Notwithstanding , that I be not further tedious unto thee , I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words .
For we have found this man a pestilent fellow , and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world , and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes :
Who also hath gone about to profane the temple : whom we took , and would have judged according to our law .
But the chief captain Lysias came upon us , and with great violence took him away out of our hands ,
Commanding his accusers to come unto thee : by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things , whereof we accuse him .
And the Jews also assented , saying that these things were so .
Then Paul , after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak , answered , Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation , I do the more cheerfully answer for myself :
Because that thou mayest understand , that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship .
And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man , neither raising up the people , neither in the synagogues , nor in the city :
Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me .
But this I confess unto thee , that after the way which they call heresy , so worship I the God of my fathers , believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets :
And have hope toward God , which they themselves also allow , that there shall be a resurrection of the dead , both of the just and unjust .
And herein do I exercise myself , to have always a conscience void to offence toward God , and toward men .
Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation , and offerings .
Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple , neither with multitude , nor with tumult .
Who ought to have been here before thee , and object , if they had ought against me .
Or else let these same here say , if they have found any evil doing in me , while I stood before the council ,
Except it be for this one voice , that I cried standing among them , Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day .
And when Felix heard these things , having more perfect knowledge of that way , he deferred them , and said , When Lysias the chief captain shall come down , I will know the uttermost of your matter .
And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul , and to let him have liberty , and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him .
And after certain days , when Felix came with his wife Drusilla , which was a Jewess , he sent for Paul , and heard him concerning the faith in Christ .
And as he reasoned of righteousness , temperance , and judgment to come , Felix trembled , and answered , Go thy way for this time ; when I have a convenient season , I will call for thee .
He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul , that he might loose him : wherefore he sent for him the oftener , and communed with him .
But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix ' room : and Felix , willing to shew the Jews a pleasure , left Paul bound .
Now when Festus was come into the province , after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem .
Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul , and besought him ,
And desired favour against him , that he would send for him to Jerusalem , laying wait in the way to kill him .
But Festus answered , that Paul should be kept at Caesarea , and that he himself would depart shortly thither .
Let them therefore , said he , which among you are able , go down with me , and accuse this man , if there be any wickedness in him .
And when he had tarried among them more than ten days , he went down unto Caesarea ; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought .
And when he was come , the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about , and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul , which they could not prove .
While he answered for himself , Neither against the law of the Jews , neither against the temple , nor yet against Caesar , have I offended any thing at all .
But Festus , willing to do the Jews a pleasure , answered Paul , and said , Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these things before me ?
Then said Paul , I stand at Caesar ' s judgment seat , where I ought to be judged : to the Jews have I done no wrong , as thou very well knowest .
For if I be an offender , or have committed any thing worthy of death , I refuse not to die : but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me , no man may deliver me unto them . I appeal unto Caesar .
Then Festus , when he had conferred with the council , answered , Hast thou appealed unto Caesar ? unto Caesar shalt thou go .
And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus .
And when they had been there many days , Festus declared Paul ' s cause unto the king , saying , There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix :
About whom , when I was at Jerusalem , the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me , desiring to have judgment against him .
To whom I answered , It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die , before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face , and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him .
Therefore , when they were come hither , without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat , and commanded the man to be brought forth .
Against whom when the accusers stood up , they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed :
But had certain questions against him of their own superstition , and of one Jesus , which was dead , whom Paul affirmed to be alive .
And because I doubted of such manner of questions , I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem , and there be judged of these matters .
But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus , I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar .
Then Agrippa said unto Festus , I would also hear the man myself . To morrow , said he , thou shalt hear him .
And on the morrow , when Agrippa was come , and Bernice , with great pomp , and was entered into the place of hearing , with the chief captains , and principal men of the city , at Festus ' commandment Paul was brought forth .
And Festus said , King Agrippa , and all men which are here present with us , ye see this man , about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me , both at Jerusalem , and also here , crying that he ought not to live any longer .
But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death , and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus , I have determined to send him .
Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord . Wherefore I have brought him forth before you , and specially before thee , O king Agrippa , that , after examination had , I might have somewhat to write .
For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner , and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him .
Then Agrippa said unto Paul , Thou art permitted to speak for thyself . Then Paul stretched forth the hand , and answered for himself :
I think myself happy , king Agrippa , because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews :
Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews : wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently .
My manner of life from my youth , which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem , know all the Jews ;
Which knew me from the beginning , if they would testify , that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee .
And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God , unto our fathers :
Unto which promise our twelve tribes , instantly serving God day and night , hope to come . For which hope ' s sake , king Agrippa , I am accused of the Jews .
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you , that God should raise the dead ?
I verily thought with myself , that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth .
Which thing I also did in Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in prison , having received authority from the chief priests ; and when they were put to death , I gave my voice against them .
And I punished them oft in every synagogue , and compelled them to blaspheme ; and being exceedingly mad against them , I persecuted them even unto strange cities .
Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests ,
At midday , O king , I saw in the way a light from heaven , above the brightness of the sun , shining round about me and them which journeyed with me .
And when we were all fallen to the earth , I heard a voice speaking unto me , and saying in the Hebrew tongue , Saul , Saul , why persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks .
And I said , Who art thou , Lord ? And he said , I am Jesus whom thou persecutest .
But rise , and stand upon thy feet : for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose , to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen , and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ;
Delivering thee from the people , and from the Gentiles , unto whom now I send thee ,
To open their eyes , and to turn them from darkness to light , and from the power of Satan unto God , that they may receive forgiveness of sins , and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me .
Whereupon , O king Agrippa , I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision :
But shewed first unto them of Damascus , and at Jerusalem , and throughout all the coasts of Judaea , and then to the Gentiles , that they should repent and turn to God , and do works meet for repentance .
For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple , and went about to kill me .
Having therefore obtained help of God , I continue unto this day , witnessing both to small and great , saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come :
That Christ should suffer , and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead , and should shew light unto the people , and to the Gentiles .
And as he thus spake for himself , Festus said with a loud voice , Paul , thou art beside thyself ; much learning doth make thee mad .
But he said , I am not mad , most noble Festus ; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness .
For the king knoweth of these things , before whom also I speak freely : for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him ; for this thing was not done in a corner .
King Agrippa , believest thou the prophets ? I know that thou believest .
Then Agrippa said unto Paul , Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian .
And Paul said , I would to God , that not only thou , but also all that hear me this day , were both almost , and altogether such as I am , except these bonds .
And when he had thus spoken , the king rose up , and the governor , and Bernice , and they that sat with them :
And when they were gone aside , they talked between themselves , saying , This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds .
Then said Agrippa unto Festus , This man might have been set at liberty , if he had not appealed unto Caesar .
And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy , they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius , a centurion of Augustus ' band .
And entering into a ship of Adramyttium , we launched , meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia ; one Aristarchus , a Macedonian of Thessalonica , being with us .
And the next day we touched at Sidon . And Julius courteously entreated Paul , and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself .
And when we had launched from thence , we sailed under Cyprus , because the winds were contrary .
And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia , we came to Myra , a city of Lycia .
And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy ; and he put us therein .
And when we had sailed slowly many days , and scarce were come over against Cnidus , the wind not suffering us , we sailed under Crete , over against Salmone ;
And , hardly passing it , came unto a place which is called The fair havens ; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea .
Now when much time was spent , and when sailing was now dangerous , because the fast was now already past , Paul admonished them ,
And said unto them , Sirs , I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage , not only of the lading and ship , but also of our lives .
Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship , more than those things which were spoken by Paul .
And because the haven was not commodious to winter in , the more part advised to depart thence also , if by any means they might attain to Phenice , and there to winter ; which is an haven of Crete , and lieth toward the south west and north west .
And when the south wind blew softly , supposing that they had obtained their purpose , loosing thence , they sailed close by Crete .
But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind , called Euroclydon .
And when the ship was caught , and could not bear up into the wind , we let her drive .
And running under a certain island which is called Clauda , we had much work to come by the boat :
Which when they had taken up , they used helps , undergirding the ship ; and , fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands , strake sail , and so were driven .
And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest , the next day they lightened the ship ;
And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship .
And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared , and no small tempest lay on us , all hope that we should be saved was then taken away .
But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them , and said , Sirs , ye should have hearkened unto me , and not have loosed from Crete , and to have gained this harm and loss .
And now I exhort you to be of good cheer : for there shall be no loss of any man ' s life among you , but of the ship .
For there stood by me this night the angel of God , whose I am , and whom I serve ,
Saying , Fear not , Paul ; thou must be brought before Caesar : and , lo , God hath given thee all them that sail with thee .
Wherefore , sirs , be of good cheer : for I believe God , that it shall be even as it was told me .
Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island .
But when the fourteenth night was come , as we were driven up and down in Adria , about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country ;
And sounded , and found it twenty fathoms : and when they had gone a little further , they sounded again , and found it fifteen fathoms .
Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks , they cast four anchors out of the stern , and wished for the day .
And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship , when they had let down the boat into the sea , under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship ,
Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers , Except these abide in the ship , ye cannot be saved .
Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat , and let her fall off .
And while the day was coming on , Paul besought them all to take meat , saying , This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting , having taken nothing .
Wherefore I pray you to take some meat : for this is for your health : for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you .
And when he had thus spoken , he took bread , and gave thanks to God in presence of them all : and when he had broken it , he began to eat .
Then were they all of good cheer , and they also took some meat .
And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls .
And when they had eaten enough , they lightened the ship , and cast out the wheat into the sea .
And when it was day , they knew not the land : but they discovered a certain creek with a shore , into the which they were minded , if it were possible , to thrust in the ship .
And when they had taken up the anchors , they committed themselves unto the sea , and loosed the rudder bands , and hoised up the mainsail to the wind , and made toward shore .
And falling into a place where two seas met , they ran the ship aground ; and the forepart stuck fast , and remained unmoveable , but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves .
And the soldiers ' counsel was to kill the prisoners , lest any of them should swim out , and escape .
But the centurion , willing to save Paul , kept them from their purpose ; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea , and get to land :
And the rest , some on boards , and some on broken pieces of the ship . And so it came to pass , that they escaped all safe to land .
Paul , a servant of Jesus Christ , called to be an apostle , separated unto the gospel of God ,
( Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures , )
Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord , which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh ;
And declared to be the Son of God with power , according to the spirit of holiness , by the resurrection from the dead :
By whom we have received grace and apostleship , for obedience to the faith among all nations , for his name :
Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ :
To all that be in Rome , beloved of God , called to be saints : Grace to you and peace from God our Father , and the Lord Jesus Christ .
First , I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all , that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world .
For God is my witness , whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son , that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers ;
Making request , if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you .
For I long to see you , that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift , to the end ye may be established ;
That is , that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me .
Now I would not have you ignorant , brethren , that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you , ( but was let hitherto , ) that I might have some fruit among you also , even as among other Gentiles .
I am debtor both to the Greeks , and to the Barbarians ; both to the wise , and to the unwise .
So , as much as in me is , I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also .
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ : for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth ; to the Jew first , and also to the Greek .
For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith : as it is written , The just shall live by faith .
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men , who hold the truth in unrighteousness ;
Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them ; for God hath shewed it unto them .
For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
Because that , when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , neither were thankful ; but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ,
And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man , and to birds , and fourfooted beasts , and creeping things .
Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonour their own bodies between themselves :
Who changed the truth of God into a lie , and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator , who is blessed for ever . Amen .
For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature :
And likewise also the men , leaving the natural use of the woman , burned in their lust one toward another ; men with men working that which is unseemly , and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet .
And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge , God gave them over to a reprobate mind , to do those things which are not convenient ;
Being filled with all unrighteousness , fornication , wickedness , covetousness , maliciousness ; full of envy , murder , debate , deceit , malignity ; whisperers ,
Backbiters , haters of God , despiteful , proud , boasters , inventors of evil things , disobedient to parents ,
Without understanding , covenantbreakers , without natural affection , implacable , unmerciful :
Who knowing the judgment of God , that they which commit such things are worthy of death , not only do the same , but have pleasure in them that do them .
Therefore thou art inexcusable , O man , whosoever thou art that judgest : for wherein thou judgest another , thou condemnest thyself ; for thou that judgest doest the same things .
But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things .
And thinkest thou this , O man , that judgest them which do such things , and doest the same , that thou shalt escape the judgment of God ?
Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering ; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance ?
But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God ;
Who will render to every man according to his deeds :
To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality , eternal life :
But unto them that are contentious , and do not obey the truth , but obey unrighteousness , indignation and wrath ,
Tribulation and anguish , upon every soul of man that doeth evil , of the Jew first , and also of the Gentile ;
But glory , honour , and peace , to every man that worketh good , to the Jew first , and also to the Gentile :
For there is no respect of persons with God .
For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law : and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law ;
( For not the hearers of the law are just before God , but the doers of the law shall be justified .
For when the Gentiles , which have not the law , do by nature the things contained in the law , these , having not the law , are a law unto themselves :
Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts , their conscience also bearing witness , and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another ; )
In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel .
Behold , thou art called a Jew , and restest in the law , and makest thy boast of God ,
And knowest his will , and approvest the things that are more excellent , being instructed out of the law ;
And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind , a light of them which are in darkness ,
An instructor of the foolish , a teacher of babes , which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law .
Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? thou that preachest a man should not steal , dost thou steal ?
Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery , dost thou commit adultery ? thou that abhorrest idols , dost thou commit sacrilege ?
Thou that makest thy boast of the law , through breaking the law dishonourest thou God ?
For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you , as it is written .
For circumcision verily profiteth , if thou keep the law : but if thou be a breaker of the law , thy circumcision is made uncircumcision .
Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law , shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision ?
And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature , if it fulfil the law , judge thee , who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law ?
For he is not a Jew , which is one outwardly ; neither is that circumcision , which is outward in the flesh :
But he is a Jew , which is one inwardly ; and circumcision is that of the heart , in the spirit , and not in the letter ; whose praise is not of men , but of God .
God , who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets ,
Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , whom he hath appointed heir of all things , by whom also he made the worlds ;
Who being the brightness of his glory , and the express image of his person , and upholding all things by the word of his power , when he had by himself purged our sins , sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high :
Being made so much better than the angels , as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they .
For unto which of the angels said he at any time , Thou art my Son , this day have I begotten thee ? And again , I will be to him a Father , and he shall be to me a Son ?
And again , when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world , he saith , And let all the angels of God worship him .
And of the angels he saith , Who maketh his angels spirits , and his ministers a flame of fire .
But unto the Son he saith , Thy throne , O God , is for ever and ever : a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom .
Thou hast loved righteousness , and hated iniquity ; therefore God , even thy God , hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows .
And , Thou , Lord , in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth ; and the heavens are the works of thine hands :
They shall perish ; but thou remainest ; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment ;
And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up , and they shall be changed : but thou art the same , and thy years shall not fail .
But to which of the angels said he at any time , Sit on my right hand , until I make thine enemies thy footstool ?
Are they not all ministering spirits , sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation ?
Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard , lest at any time we should let them slip .
For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast , and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward ;
How shall we escape , if we neglect so great salvation ; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord , and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him ;
God also bearing them witness , both with signs and wonders , and with divers miracles , and gifts of the Holy Ghost , according to his own will ?
For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come , whereof we speak .
But one in a certain place testified , saying , What is man , that thou art mindful of him ? or the son of man that thou visitest him ?
Thou madest him a little lower than the angels ; thou crownedst him with glory and honour , and didst set him over the works of thy hands :
Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet . For in that he put all in subjection under him , he left nothing that is not put under him . But now we see not yet all things put under him .
But we see Jesus , who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death , crowned with glory and honour ; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man .
For it became him , for whom are all things , and by whom are all things , in bringing many sons unto glory , to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings .
For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one : for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren ,
Saying , I will declare thy name unto my brethren , in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee .
And again , I will put my trust in him . And again , Behold I and the children which God hath given me .
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood , he also himself likewise took part of the same ; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death , that is , the devil ;
And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
For verily he took not on him the nature of angels ; but he took on him the seed of Abraham .
Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren , that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God , to make reconciliation for the sins of the people .
For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted , he is able to succour them that are tempted .
Wherefore , holy brethren , partakers of the heavenly calling , consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession , Christ Jesus ;
Who was faithful to him that appointed him , as also Moses was faithful in all his house .
For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses , inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house .
For every house is builded by some man ; but he that built all things is God .
And Moses verily was faithful in all his house , as a servant , for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after ;
But Christ as a son over his own house ; whose house are we , if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end .
Wherefore ( as the Holy Ghost saith , To day if ye will hear his voice ,
Harden not your hearts , as in the provocation , in the day of temptation in the wilderness :
When your fathers tempted me , proved me , and saw my works forty years .
Wherefore I was grieved with that generation , and said , They do alway err in their heart ; and they have not known my ways .
So I sware in my wrath , They shall not enter into my rest . )
Take heed , brethren , lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief , in departing from the living God .
But exhort one another daily , while it is called To day ; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin .
For we are made partakers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end ;
While it is said , To day if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts , as in the provocation .
For some , when they had heard , did provoke : howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses .
But with whom was he grieved forty years ? was it not with them that had sinned , whose carcases fell in the wilderness ?
And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest , but to them that believed not ?
So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief .
Let us therefore fear , lest , a promise being left us of entering into his rest , any of you should seem to come short of it .
For unto us was the gospel preached , as well as unto them : but the word preached did not profit them , not being mixed with faith in them that heard it .
For we which have believed do enter into rest , as he said , As I have sworn in my wrath , if they shall enter into my rest : although the works were finished from the foundation of the world .
For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise , And God did rest the seventh day from all his works .
And in this place again , If they shall enter into my rest .
Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein , and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief :
Again , he limiteth a certain day , saying in David , To day , after so long a time ; as it is said , To day if ye will hear his voice , harden not your hearts .
For if Jesus had given them rest , then would he not afterward have spoken of another day .
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God .
For he that is entered into his rest , he also hath ceased from his own works , as God did from his .
Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest , lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief .
For the word of God is quick , and powerful , and sharper than any twoedged sword , piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit , and of the joints and marrow , and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart .
Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight : but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do .
Seeing then that we have a great high priest , that is passed into the heavens , Jesus the Son of God , let us hold fast our profession .
For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities ; but was in all points tempted like as we are , yet without sin .
Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace , that we may obtain mercy , and find grace to help in time of need .
For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God , that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins :
Who can have compassion on the ignorant , and on them that are out of the way ; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity .
And by reason hereof he ought , as for the people , so also for himself , to offer for sins .
And no man taketh this honour unto himself , but he that is called of God , as was Aaron .
So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest ; but he that said unto him , Thou art my Son , to day have I begotten thee .
As he saith also in another place , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
Who in the days of his flesh , when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death , and was heard in that he feared ;
Though he were a Son , yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered ;
And being made perfect , he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him ;
Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec .
Of whom we have many things to say , and hard to be uttered , seeing ye are dull of hearing .
For when for the time ye ought to be teachers , ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God ; and are become such as have need of milk , and not of strong meat .
For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness : for he is a babe .
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age , even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil .
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ , let us go on unto perfection ; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works , and of faith toward God ,
Of the doctrine of baptisms , and of laying on of hands , and of resurrection of the dead , and of eternal judgment .
And this will we do , if God permit .
For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened , and have tasted of the heavenly gift , and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost ,
And have tasted the good word of God , and the powers of the world to come ,
If they shall fall away , to renew them again unto repentance ; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh , and put him to an open shame .
For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed , receiveth blessing from God :
But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected , and is nigh unto cursing ; whose end is to be burned .
But , beloved , we are persuaded better things of you , and things that accompany salvation , though we thus speak .
For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love , which ye have shewed toward his name , in that ye have ministered to the saints , and do minister .
And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end :
That ye be not slothful , but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises .
For when God made promise to Abraham , because he could swear by no greater , he sware by himself ,
Saying , Surely blessing I will bless thee , and multiplying I will multiply thee .
And so , after he had patiently endured , he obtained the promise .
For men verily swear by the greater : and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife .
Wherein God , willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel , confirmed it by an oath :
That by two immutable things , in which it was impossible for God to lie , we might have a strong consolation , who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us :
Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul , both sure and stedfast , and which entereth into that within the veil ;
Whither the forerunner is for us entered , even Jesus , made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
For this Melchisedec , king of Salem , priest of the most high God , who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings , and blessed him ;
To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all ; first being by interpretation King of righteousness , and after that also King of Salem , which is , King of peace ;
Without father , without mother , without descent , having neither beginning of days , nor end of life ; but made like unto the Son of God ; abideth a priest continually .
Now consider how great this man was , unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils .
And verily they that are of the sons of Levi , who receive the office of the priesthood , have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law , that is , of their brethren , though they come out of the loins of Abraham :
But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham , and blessed him that had the promises .
And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better .
And here men that die receive tithes ; but there he receiveth them , of whom it is witnessed that he liveth .
And as I may so say , Levi also , who receiveth tithes , payed tithes in Abraham .
For he was yet in the loins of his father , when Melchisedec met him .
If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood , ( for under it the people received the law , ) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec , and not be called after the order of Aaron ?
For the priesthood being changed , there is made of necessity a change also of the law .
For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe , of which no man gave attendance at the altar .
For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda ; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood .
And it is yet far more evident : for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest ,
Who is made , not after the law of a carnal commandment , but after the power of an endless life .
For he testifieth , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec .
For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof .
For the law made nothing perfect , but the bringing in of a better hope did ; by the which we draw nigh unto God .
And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest :
( For those priests were made without an oath ; but this with an oath by him that said unto him , The Lord sware and will not repent , Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec : )
By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament .
And they truly were many priests , because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death :
But this man , because he continueth ever , hath an unchangeable priesthood .
Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him , seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them .
For such an high priest became us , who is holy , harmless , undefiled , separate from sinners , and made higher than the heavens ;
Who needeth not daily , as those high priests , to offer up sacrifice , first for his own sins , and then for the people ' s : for this he did once , when he offered up himself .
For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity ; but the word of the oath , which was since the law , maketh the Son , who is consecrated for evermore .
Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum : We have such an high priest , who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens ;
A minister of the sanctuary , and of the true tabernacle , which the Lord pitched , and not man .
For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices : wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer .
For if he were on earth , he should not be a priest , seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law :
Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things , as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle : for , See , saith he , that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount .
But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry , by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant , which was established upon better promises .
For if that first covenant had been faultless , then should no place have been sought for the second .
For finding fault with them , he saith , Behold , the days come , saith the Lord , when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah :
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt ; because they continued not in my covenant , and I regarded them not , saith the Lord .
For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days , saith the Lord ; I will put my laws into their mind , and write them in their hearts : and I will be to them a God , and they shall be to me a people :
And they shall not teach every man his neighbour , and every man his brother , saying , Know the Lord : for all shall know me , from the least to the greatest .
For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness , and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more .
In that he saith , A new covenant , he hath made the first old . Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away .
Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service , and a worldly sanctuary .
For there was a tabernacle made ; the first , wherein was the candlestick , and the table , and the shewbread ; which is called the sanctuary .
And after the second veil , the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all ;
Which had the golden censer , and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold , wherein was the golden pot that had manna , and Aaron ' s rod that budded , and the tables of the covenant ;
And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat ; of which we cannot now speak particularly .
Now when these things were thus ordained , the priests went always into the first tabernacle , accomplishing the service of God .
But into the second went the high priest alone once every year , not without blood , which he offered for himself , and for the errors of the people :
The Holy Ghost this signifying , that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest , while as the first tabernacle was yet standing :
Which was a figure for the time then present , in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices , that could not make him that did the service perfect , as pertaining to the conscience ;
Which stood only in meats and drinks , and divers washings , and carnal ordinances , imposed on them until the time of reformation .
But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come , by a greater and more perfect tabernacle , not made with hands , that is to say , not of this building ;
Neither by the blood of goats and calves , but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place , having obtained eternal redemption for us .
For if the blood of bulls and of goats , and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean , sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh :
How much more shall the blood of Christ , who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God , purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God ?
And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament , that by means of death , for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament , they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance .
For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator .
For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth .
Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood .
For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law , he took the blood of calves and of goats , with water , and scarlet wool , and hyssop , and sprinkled both the book , and all the people ,
Saying , This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you .
Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle , and all the vessels of the ministry .
And almost all things are by the law purged with blood ; and without shedding of blood is no remission .
It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these ; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these .
For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands , which are the figures of the true ; but into heaven itself , now to appear in the presence of God for us :
Nor yet that he should offer himself often , as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others ;
For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world : but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself .
And as it is appointed unto men once to die , but after this the judgment :
So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many ; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation .
For the law having a shadow of good things to come , and not the very image of the things , can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect .
For then would they not have ceased to be offered ? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins .
But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year .
For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins .
Wherefore when he cometh into the world , he saith , Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not , but a body hast thou prepared me :
In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure .
Then said I , Lo , I come ( in the volume of the book it is written of me , ) to do thy will , O God .
Above when he said , Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not , neither hadst pleasure therein ; which are offered by the law ;
Then said he , Lo , I come to do thy will , O God . He taketh away the first , that he may establish the second .
By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all .
And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices , which can never take away sins :
But this man , after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever , sat down on the right hand of God ;
From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool .
For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified .
Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us : for after that he had said before ,
This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days , saith the Lord , I will put my laws into their hearts , and in their minds will I write them ;
And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more .
Now where remission of these is , there is no more offering for sin .
Having therefore , brethren , boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus ,
By a new and living way , which he hath consecrated for us , through the veil , that is to say , his flesh ;
And having an high priest over the house of God ;
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith , having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience , and our bodies washed with pure water .
Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering ; ( for he is faithful that promised ; )
And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works :
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together , as the manner of some is ; but exhorting one another : and so much the more , as ye see the day approaching .
For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins ,
But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries .
He that despised Moses ' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses :
Of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath counted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace ?
For we know him that hath said , Vengeance belongeth unto me , I will recompense , saith the Lord . And again , The Lord shall judge his people .
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God .
But call to remembrance the former days , in which , after ye were illuminated , ye endured a great fight of afflictions ;
Partly , whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions ; and partly , whilst ye became companions of them that were so used .
For ye had compassion of me in my bonds , and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods , knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance .
Cast not away therefore your confidence , which hath great recompence of reward .
For ye have need of patience , that , after ye have done the will of God , ye might receive the promise .
For yet a little while , and he that shall come will come , and will not tarry .
Now the just shall live by faith : but if any man draw back , my soul shall have no pleasure in him .
But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition ; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul .
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen .
For by it the elders obtained a good report .
Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God , so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear .
By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain , by which he obtained witness that he was righteous , God testifying of his gifts : and by it he being dead yet speaketh .
By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death ; and was not found , because God had translated him : for before his translation he had this testimony , that he pleased God .
But without faith it is impossible to please him : for he that cometh to God must believe that he is , and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him .
By faith Noah , being warned of God of things not seen as yet , moved with fear , prepared an ark to the saving of his house ; by the which he condemned the world , and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith .
By faith Abraham , when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance , obeyed ; and he went out , not knowing whither he went .
By faith he sojourned in the land of promise , as in a strange country , dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob , the heirs with him of the same promise :
For he looked for a city which hath foundations , whose builder and maker is God .
Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed , and was delivered of a child when she was past age , because she judged him faithful who had promised .
Therefore sprang there even of one , and him as good as dead , so many as the stars of the sky in multitude , and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable .
These all died in faith , not having received the promises , but having seen them afar off , and were persuaded of them , and embraced them , and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth .
For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country .
And truly , if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out , they might have had opportunity to have returned .
But now they desire a better country , that is , an heavenly : wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God : for he hath prepared for them a city .
By faith Abraham , when he was tried , offered up Isaac : and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son ,
Of whom it was said , That in Isaac shall thy seed be called :
Accounting that God was able to raise him up , even from the dead ; from whence also he received him in a figure .
By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come .
By faith Jacob , when he was a dying , blessed both the sons of Joseph ; and worshipped , leaning upon the top of his staff .
By faith Joseph , when he died , made mention of the departing of the children of Israel ; and gave commandment concerning his bones .
By faith Moses , when he was born , was hid three months of his parents , because they saw he was a proper child ; and they were not afraid of the king ' s commandment .
By faith Moses , when he was come to years , refused to be called the son of Pharaoh ' s daughter ;
Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God , than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season ;
Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt : for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward .
By faith he forsook Egypt , not fearing the wrath of the king : for he endured , as seeing him who is invisible .
Through faith he kept the passover , and the sprinkling of blood , lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them .
By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land : which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned .
By faith the walls of Jericho fell down , after they were compassed about seven days .
By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not , when she had received the spies with peace .
And what shall I more say ? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon , and of Barak , and of Samson , and of Jephthae ; of David also , and Samuel , and of the prophets :
Who through faith subdued kingdoms , wrought righteousness , obtained promises , stopped the mouths of lions .
Quenched the violence of fire , escaped the edge of the sword , out of weakness were made strong , waxed valiant in fight , turned to flight the armies of the aliens .
Women received their dead raised to life again : and others were tortured , not accepting deliverance ; that they might obtain a better resurrection :
And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings , yea , moreover of bonds and imprisonment :
They were stoned , they were sawn asunder , were tempted , were slain with the sword : they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins ; being destitute , afflicted , tormented ;
( Of whom the world was not worthy : ) they wandered in deserts , and in mountains , and in dens and caves of the earth .
And these all , having obtained a good report through faith , received not the promise :
God having provided some better thing for us , that they without us should not be made perfect .
Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses , let us lay aside every weight , and the sin which doth so easily beset us , and let us run with patience the race that is set before us ,
Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith ; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross , despising the shame , and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God .
For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself , lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds .
Ye have not yet resisted unto blood , striving against sin .
And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children , My son , despise not thou the chastening of the Lord , nor faint when thou art rebuked of him :
For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth , and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth .
If ye endure chastening , God dealeth with you as with sons ; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not ?
But if ye be without chastisement , whereof all are partakers , then are ye bastards , and not sons .
Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us , and we gave them reverence : shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits , and live ?
For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure ; but he for our profit , that we might be partakers of his holiness .
Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous , but grievous : nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby .
Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down , and the feeble knees ;
And make straight paths for your feet , lest that which is lame be turned out of the way ; but let it rather be healed .
Follow peace with all men , and holiness , without which no man shall see the Lord :
Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God ; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you , and thereby many be defiled ;
Lest there be any fornicator , or profane person , as Esau , who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright .
For ye know how that afterward , when he would have inherited the blessing , he was rejected : for he found no place of repentance , though he sought it carefully with tears .
For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched , and that burned with fire , nor unto blackness , and darkness , and tempest ,
And the sound of a trumpet , and the voice of words ; which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more :
( For they could not endure that which was commanded , And if so much as a beast touch the mountain , it shall be stoned , or thrust through with a dart :
And so terrible was the sight , that Moses said , I exceedingly fear and quake : )
But ye are come unto mount Sion , and unto the city of the living God , the heavenly Jerusalem , and to an innumerable company of angels ,
To the general assembly and church of the firstborn , which are written in heaven , and to God the Judge of all , and to the spirits of just men made perfect ,
And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant , and to the blood of sprinkling , that speaketh better things that that of Abel .
See that ye refuse not him that speaketh . For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth , much more shall not we escape , if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven :
Whose voice then shook the earth : but now he hath promised , saying , Yet once more I shake not the earth only , but also heaven .
And this word , Yet once more , signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken , as of things that are made , that those things which cannot be shaken may remain .
Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved , let us have grace , whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear :
For our God is a consuming fire .
James , a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ , to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad , greeting .
My brethren , count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations ;
Knowing this , that the trying of your faith worketh patience .
But let patience have her perfect work , that ye may be perfect and entire , wanting nothing .
If any of you lack wisdom , let him ask of God , that giveth to all men liberally , and upbraideth not ; and it shall be given him .
But let him ask in faith , nothing wavering . For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed .
For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord .
A double minded man is unstable in all his ways .
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted :
But the rich , in that he is made low : because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away .
For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat , but it withereth the grass , and the flower thereof falleth , and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth : so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways .
Blessed is the man that endureth temptation : for when he is tried , he shall receive the crown of life , which the Lord hath promised to them that love him .
Let no man say when he is tempted , I am tempted of God : for God cannot be tempted with evil , neither tempteth he any man :
But every man is tempted , when he is drawn away of his own lust , and enticed .
Then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin : and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death .
Do not err , my beloved brethren .
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights , with whom is no variableness , neither shadow of turning .
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth , that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures .
Wherefore , my beloved brethren , let every man be swift to hear , slow to speak , slow to wrath :
For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God .
Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness , and receive with meekness the engrafted word , which is able to save your souls .
But be ye doers of the word , and not hearers only , deceiving your own selves .
For if any be a hearer of the word , and not a doer , he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass :
For he beholdeth himself , and goeth his way , and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was .
But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty , and continueth therein , he being not a forgetful hearer , but a doer of the work , this man shall be blessed in his deed .
If any man among you seem to be religious , and bridleth not his tongue , but deceiveth his own heart , this man ' s religion is vain .
Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this , To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world .
My brethren , have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ , the Lord of glory , with respect of persons .
For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring , in goodly apparel , and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment ;
And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing , and say unto him , Sit thou here in a good place ; and say to the poor , Stand thou there , or sit here under my footstool :
Are ye not then partial in yourselves , and are become judges of evil thoughts ?
Hearken , my beloved brethren , Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith , and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him ?
But ye have despised the poor . Do not rich men oppress you , and draw you before the judgment seats ?
Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called ?
If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture , Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself , ye do well :
But if ye have respect to persons , ye commit sin , and are convinced of the law as transgressors .
For whosoever shall keep the whole law , and yet offend in one point , he is guilty of all .
For he that said , Do not commit adultery , said also , Do not kill . Now if thou commit no adultery , yet if thou kill , thou art become a transgressor of the law .
So speak ye , and so do , as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty .
For he shall have judgment without mercy , that hath shewed no mercy ; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment .
What doth it profit , my brethren , though a man say he hath faith , and have not works ? can faith save him ?
If a brother or sister be naked , and destitute of daily food ,
And one of you say unto them , Depart in peace , be ye warmed and filled ; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body ; what doth it profit ?
Even so faith , if it hath not works , is dead , being alone .
Yea , a man may say , Thou hast faith , and I have works : shew me thy faith without thy works , and I will shew thee my faith by my works .
Thou believest that there is one God ; thou doest well : the devils also believe , and tremble .
But wilt thou know , O vain man , that faith without works is dead ?
Was not Abraham our father justified by works , when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar ?
Seest thou how faith wrought with his works , and by works was faith made perfect ?
And the scripture was fulfilled which saith , Abraham believed God , and it was imputed unto him for righteousness : and he was called the Friend of God .
Ye see then how that by works a man is justified , and not by faith only .
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works , when she had received the messengers , and had sent them out another way ?
For as the body without the spirit is dead , so faith without works is dead also .
My brethren , be not many masters , knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation .
For in many things we offend all . If any man offend not in word , the same is a perfect man , and able also to bridle the whole body .
Behold , we put bits in the horses ' mouths , that they may obey us ; and we turn about their whole body .
Behold also the ships , which though they be so great , and are driven of fierce winds , yet are they turned about with a very small helm , whithersoever the governor listeth .
Even so the tongue is a little member , and boasteth great things . Behold , how great a matter a little fire kindleth !
And the tongue is a fire , a world of iniquity : so is the tongue among our members , that it defileth the whole body , and setteth on fire the course of nature ; and it is set on fire of hell .
For every kind of beasts , and of birds , and of serpents , and of things in the sea , is tamed , and hath been tamed of mankind :
But the tongue can no man tame ; it is an unruly evil , full of deadly poison .
Therewith bless we God , even the Father ; and therewith curse we men , which are made after the similitude of God .
Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing . My brethren , these things ought not so to be .
Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter ?
Can the fig tree , my brethren , bear olive berries ? either a vine , figs ? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh .
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you ? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom .
But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts , glory not , and lie not against the truth .
This wisdom descendeth not from above , but is earthly , sensual , devilish .
For where envying and strife is , there is confusion and every evil work .
But the wisdom that is from above is first pure , then peaceable , gentle , and easy to be intreated , full of mercy and good fruits , without partiality , and without hypocrisy .
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace .
From whence come wars and fightings among you ? come they not hence , even of your lusts that war in your members ?
Ye lust , and have not : ye kill , and desire to have , and cannot obtain : ye fight and war , yet ye have not , because ye ask not .
Ye ask , and receive not , because ye ask amiss , that ye may consume it upon your lusts .
Ye adulterers and adulteresses , know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God ? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God .
Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain , The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy ?
But he giveth more grace . Wherefore he saith , God resisteth the proud , but giveth grace unto the humble .
Submit yourselves therefore to God . Resist the devil , and he will flee from you .
Draw nigh to God , and he will draw nigh to you . Cleanse your hands , ye sinners ; and purify your hearts , ye double minded .
Be afflicted , and mourn , and weep : let your laughter be turned to mourning , and your joy to heaviness .
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord , and he shall lift you up .
Speak not evil one of another , brethren . He that speaketh evil of his brother , and judgeth his brother , speaketh evil of the law , and judgeth the law : but if thou judge the law , thou art not a doer of the law , but a judge .
There is one lawgiver , who is able to save and to destroy : who art thou that judgest another ?
Go to now , ye that say , To day or to morrow we will go into such a city , and continue there a year , and buy and sell , and get gain :
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow . For what is your life ? It is even a vapour , that appeareth for a little time , and then vanisheth away .
For that ye ought to say , If the Lord will , we shall live , and do this , or that .
But now ye rejoice in your boastings : all such rejoicing is evil .
Therefore to him that knoweth to do good , and doeth it not , to him it is sin .
Peter , an apostle of Jesus Christ , to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus , Galatia , Cappadocia , Asia , and Bithynia ,
Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father , through sanctification of the Spirit , unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ : Grace unto you , and peace , be multiplied .
Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ , which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead ,
To an inheritance incorruptible , and undefiled , and that fadeth not away , reserved in heaven for you ,
Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time .
Wherein ye greatly rejoice , though now for a season , if need be , ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations :
That the trial of your faith , being much more precious than of gold that perisheth , though it be tried with fire , might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ :
Whom having not seen , ye love ; in whom , though now ye see him not , yet believing , ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory :
Receiving the end of your faith , even the salvation of your souls .
Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently , who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you :
Searching what , or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify , when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ , and the glory that should follow .
Unto whom it was revealed , that not unto themselves , but unto us they did minister the things , which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven ; which things the angels desire to look into .
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind , be sober , and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ ;
As obedient children , not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance :
But as he which hath called you is holy , so be ye holy in all manner of conversation ;
Because it is written , Be ye holy ; for I am holy .
And if ye call on the Father , who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man ' s work , pass the time of your sojourning here in fear :
Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things , as silver and gold , from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers ;
But with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb without blemish and without spot :
Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world , but was manifest in these last times for you ,
Who by him do believe in God , that raised him up from the dead , and gave him glory ; that your faith and hope might be in God .
Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren , see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently :
Being born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by the word of God , which liveth and abideth for ever .
For all flesh is as grass , and all the glory of man as the flower of grass . The grass withereth , and the flower thereof falleth away :
But the word of the Lord endureth for ever . And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you .
Wherefore laying aside all malice , and all guile , and hypocrisies , and envies , all evil speakings ,
As newborn babes , desire the sincere milk of the word , that ye may grow thereby :
If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious .
To whom coming , as unto a living stone , disallowed indeed of men , but chosen of God , and precious ,
Ye also , as lively stones , are built up a spiritual house , an holy priesthood , to offer up spiritual sacrifices , acceptable to God by Jesus Christ .
Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture , Behold , I lay in Sion a chief corner stone , elect , precious : and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded .
Unto you therefore which believe he is precious : but unto them which be disobedient , the stone which the builders disallowed , the same is made the head of the corner ,
And a stone of stumbling , and a rock of offence , even to them which stumble at the word , being disobedient : whereunto also they were appointed .
But ye are a chosen generation , a royal priesthood , an holy nation , a peculiar people ; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light ;
Which in time past were not a people , but are now the people of God : which had not obtained mercy , but now have obtained mercy .
Dearly beloved , I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims , abstain from fleshly lusts , which war against the soul ;
Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles : that , whereas they speak against you as evildoers , they may by your good works , which they shall behold , glorify God in the day of visitation .
Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord ' s sake : whether it be to the king , as supreme ;
Or unto governors , as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers , and for the praise of them that do well .
For so is the will of God , that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men :
As free , and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness , but as the servants of God .
Honour all men . Love the brotherhood . Fear God . Honour the king .
Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear ; not only to the good and gentle , but also to the froward .
For this is thankworthy , if a man for conscience toward God endure grief , suffering wrongfully .
For what glory is it , if , when ye be buffeted for your faults , ye shall take it patiently ? but if , when ye do well , and suffer for it , ye take it patiently , this is acceptable with God .
For even hereunto were ye called : because Christ also suffered for us , leaving us an example , that ye should follow his steps :
Who did no sin , neither was guile found in his mouth :
Who , when he was reviled , reviled not again ; when he suffered , he threatened not ; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously :
Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree , that we , being dead to sins , should live unto righteousness : by whose stripes ye were healed .
For ye were as sheep going astray ; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls .
Likewise , ye wives , be in subjection to your own husbands ; that , if any obey not the word , they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives ;
While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear .
Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair , and of wearing of gold , or of putting on of apparel ;
But let it be the hidden man of the heart , in that which is not corruptible , even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit , which is in the sight of God of great price .
For after this manner in the old time the holy women also , who trusted in God , adorned themselves , being in subjection unto their own husbands :
Even as Sara obeyed Abraham , calling him lord : whose daughters ye are , as long as ye do well , and are not afraid with any amazement .
Likewise , ye husbands , dwell with them according to knowledge , giving honour unto the wife , as unto the weaker vessel , and as being heirs together of the grace of life ; that your prayers be not hindered .
Finally , be ye all of one mind , having compassion one of another , love as brethren , be pitiful , be courteous :
Not rendering evil for evil , or railing for railing : but contrariwise blessing ; knowing that ye are thereunto called , that ye should inherit a blessing .
For he that will love life , and see good days , let him refrain his tongue from evil , and his lips that they speak no guile :
Let him eschew evil , and do good ; let him seek peace , and ensue it .
For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous , and his ears are open unto their prayers : but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil .
And who is he that will harm you , if ye be followers of that which is good ?
But and if ye suffer for righteousness ' sake , happy are ye : and be not afraid of their terror , neither be troubled ;
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts : and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear :
Having a good conscience ; that , whereas they speak evil of you , as of evildoers , they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ .
For it is better , if the will of God be so , that ye suffer for well doing , than for evil doing .
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins , the just for the unjust , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh , but quickened by the Spirit :
By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison ;
Which sometime were disobedient , when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah , while the ark was a preparing , wherein few , that is , eight souls were saved by water .
The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us ( not the putting away of the filth of the flesh , but the answer of a good conscience toward God , ) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ :
Who is gone into heaven , and is on the right hand of God ; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him .
Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh , arm yourselves likewise with the same mind : for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin ;
That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men , but to the will of God .
For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles , when we walked in lasciviousness , lusts , excess of wine , revellings , banquetings , and abominable idolatries :
Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot , speaking evil of you :
Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead .
For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit .
But the end of all things is at hand : be ye therefore sober , and watch unto prayer .
And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves : for charity shall cover the multitude of sins .
Use hospitality one to another without grudging .
As every man hath received the gift , even so minister the same one to another , as good stewards of the manifold grace of God .
If any man speak , let him speak as the oracles of God ; if any man minister , let him do it as of the ability which God giveth : that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ , to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
Beloved , think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you , as though some strange thing happened unto you :
But rejoice , inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ ' s sufferings ; that , when his glory shall be revealed , ye may be glad also with exceeding joy .
If ye be reproached for the name of Christ , happy are ye ; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you : on their part he is evil spoken of , but on your part he is glorified .
But let none of you suffer as a murderer , or as a thief , or as an evildoer , or as a busybody in other men ' s matters .
Yet if any man suffer as a Christian , let him not be ashamed ; but let him glorify God on this behalf .
For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God : and if it first begin at us , what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God ?
And if the righteous scarcely be saved , where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ?
Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing , as unto a faithful Creator .
Simon Peter , a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ , to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ :
Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God , and of Jesus our Lord ,
According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness , through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue :
Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises : that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature , having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust .
And beside this , giving all diligence , add to your faith virtue ; and to virtue knowledge ;
And to knowledge temperance ; and to temperance patience ; and to patience godliness ;
And to godliness brotherly kindness ; and to brotherly kindness charity .
For if these things be in you , and abound , they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ .
But he that lacketh these things is blind , and cannot see afar off , and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins .
Wherefore the rather , brethren , give diligence to make your calling and election sure : for if ye do these things , ye shall never fall :
For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ .
Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things , though ye know them , and be established in the present truth .
Yea , I think it meet , as long as I am in this tabernacle , to stir you up by putting you in remembrance ;
Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle , even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me .
Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance .
For we have not followed cunningly devised fables , when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ , but were eyewitnesses of his majesty .
For he received from God the Father honour and glory , when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory , This is my beloved Son , in whom I am well pleased .
And this voice which came from heaven we heard , when we were with him in the holy mount .
We have also a more sure word of prophecy ; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed , as unto a light that shineth in a dark place , until the day dawn , and the day star arise in your hearts :
Knowing this first , that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation .
For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man : but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost .
But there were false prophets also among the people , even as there shall be false teachers among you , who privily shall bring in damnable heresies , even denying the Lord that bought them , and bring upon themselves swift destruction .
And many shall follow their pernicious ways ; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of .
And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you : whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not , and their damnation slumbereth not .
For if God spared not the angels that sinned , but cast them down to hell , and delivered them into chains of darkness , to be reserved unto judgment ;
And spared not the old world , but saved Noah the eighth person , a preacher of righteousness , bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly ;
And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow , making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly ;
And delivered just Lot , vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked :
( For that righteous man dwelling among them , in seeing and hearing , vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds ; )
The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations , and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished :
But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness , and despise government . Presumptuous are they , selfwilled , they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities .
Whereas angels , which are greater in power and might , bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord .
But these , as natural brute beasts , made to be taken and destroyed , speak evil of the things that they understand not ; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption ;
And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness , as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time . Spots they are and blemishes , sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you ;
Having eyes full of adultery , and that cannot cease from sin ; beguiling unstable souls : an heart they have exercised with covetous practices ; cursed children :
Which have forsaken the right way , and are gone astray , following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor , who loved the wages of unrighteousness ;
But was rebuked for his iniquity : the dumb ass speaking with man ' s voice forbad the madness of the prophet .
These are wells without water , clouds that are carried with a tempest ; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever .
For when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness , those that were clean escaped from them who live in error .
While they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption : for of whom a man is overcome , of the same is he brought in bondage .
For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ , they are again entangled therein , and overcome , the latter end is worse with them than the beginning .
For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness , than , after they have known it , to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them .
But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb , The dog is turned to his own vomit again ; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire .
That which was from the beginning , which we have heard , which we have seen with our eyes , which we have looked upon , and our hands have handled , of the Word of life ;
( For the life was manifested , and we have seen it , and bear witness , and shew unto you that eternal life , which was with the Father , and was manifested unto us ; )
That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you , that ye also may have fellowship with us : and truly our fellowship is with the Father , and with his Son Jesus Christ .
And these things write we unto you , that your joy may be full .
This then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
If we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth :
But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin .
If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
If we say that we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
My little children , these things write I unto you , that ye sin not . And if any man sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous :
And he is the propitiation for our sins : and not for our ' s only , but also for the sins of the whole world .
And hereby we do know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
He that saith , I know him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
But whoso keepeth his word , in him verily is the love of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk , even as he walked .
Brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
Again , a new commandment I write unto you , which thing is true in him and in you : because the darkness is past , and the true light now shineth .
He that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now .
He that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is none occasion of stumbling in him .
But he that hateth his brother is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes .
I write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name ' s sake .
I write unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome the wicked one . I write unto you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever .
Little children , it is the last time : and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come , even now are there many antichrists ; whereby we know that it is the last time .
They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us .
But ye have an unction from the Holy One , and ye know all things .
I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? He is antichrist , that denieth the Father and the Son .
Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also .
Let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the Father .
And this is the promise that he hath promised us , even eternal life .
These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you .
But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you , and ye need not that any man teach you : but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is truth , and is no lie , and even as it hath taught you , ye shall abide in him .
And now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
If ye know that he is righteous , ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him .
Behold , what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God : therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew him not .
Beloved , now are we the sons of God , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law : for sin is the transgression of the law .
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins ; and in him is no sin .
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not : whosoever sinneth hath not seen him , neither known him .
Little children , let no man deceive you : he that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous .
He that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . For this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin ; for his seed remaineth in him : and he cannot sin , because he is born of God .
In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another .
Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . And wherefore slew he him ? Because his own works were evil , and his brother ' s righteous .
Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
We know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . He that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
Hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
But whoso hath this world ' s good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
My little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
And hereby we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hearts before him .
For if our heart condemn us , God is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
Beloved , if our heart condemn us not , then have we confidence toward God .
And whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight .
And this is his commandment , That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , as he gave us commandment .
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him , and he in him . And hereby we know that he abideth in us , by the Spirit which he hath given us .
Beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of God : because many false prophets are gone out into the world .
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God : Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God :
And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
Ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
They are of the world : therefore speak they of the world , and the world heareth them .
We are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us . Hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
Beloved , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that loveth is born of God , and knoweth God .
He that loveth not knoweth not God ; for God is love .
In this was manifested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
Herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins .
Beloved , if God so loved us , we ought also to love one another .
No man hath seen God at any time . If we love one another , God dwelleth in us , and his love is perfected in us .
Hereby know we that we dwell in him , and he in us , because he hath given us of his Spirit .
And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world .
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God dwelleth in him , and he in God .
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us . God is love ; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God , and God in him .
Herein is our love made perfect , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment : because as he is , so are we in this world .
There is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear : because fear hath torment . He that feareth is not made perfect in love .
We love him , because he first loved us .
If a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
And this commandment have we from him , That he who loveth God love his brother also .
The Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John :
Who bare record of the word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all things that he saw .
Blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
John to the seven churches which are in Asia : Grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne ;
And from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , and the first begotten of the dead , and the prince of the kings of the earth . Unto him that loved us , and washed us from our sins in his own blood ,
And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
Behold , he cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him . Even so , Amen .
I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the ending , saith the Lord , which is , and which was , and which is to come , the Almighty .
I John , who also am your brother , and companion in tribulation , and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was in the isle that is called Patmos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
I was in the Spirit on the Lord ' s day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet ,
Saying , I am Alpha and Omega , the first and the last : and , What thou seest , write in a book , and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia ; unto Ephesus , and unto Smyrna , and unto Pergamos , and unto Thyatira , and unto Sardis , and unto Philadelphia , and unto Laodicea .
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me . And being turned , I saw seven golden candlesticks ;
And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man , clothed with a garment down to the foot , and girt about the paps with a golden girdle .
His head and his hairs were white like wool , as white as snow ; and his eyes were as a flame of fire ;
And his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
And he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword : and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
And when I saw him , I fell at his feet as dead . And he laid his right hand upon me , saying unto me , Fear not ; I am the first and the last :
I am he that liveth , and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive for evermore , Amen ; and have the keys of hell and of death .
Write the things which thou hast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be hereafter ;
The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks . The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write ; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand , who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks ;
I know thy works , and thy labour , and thy patience , and how thou canst not bear them which are evil : and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles , and are not , and hast found them liars :
And hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name ' s sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee , because thou hast left thy first love .
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen , and repent , and do the first works ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will remove thy candlestick out of his place , except thou repent .
But this thou hast , that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes , which I also hate .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God .
And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write ; These things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive ;
I know thy works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer : behold , the devil shall cast some of you into prison , that ye may be tried ; and ye shall have tribulation ten days : be thou faithful unto death , and I will give thee a crown of life .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death .
And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write ; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges ;
I know thy works , and where thou dwellest , even where Satan ' s seat is : and thou holdest fast my name , and hast not denied my faith , even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr , who was slain among you , where Satan dwelleth .
But I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit fornication .
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes , which thing I hate .
Repent ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna , and will give him a white stone , and in the stone a new name written , which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it .
And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write ; These things saith the Son of God , who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire , and his feet are like fine brass ;
I know thy works , and charity , and service , and faith , and thy patience , and thy works ; and the last to be more than the first .
Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel , which calleth herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication ; and she repented not .
Behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
And I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
But unto you I say , and unto the rest in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
But that which ye have already hold fast till I come .
And he that overcometh , and keepeth my works unto the end , to him will I give power over the nations :
And he shall rule them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers : even as I received of my Father .
And I will give him the morning star .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
Be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found thy works perfect before God .
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth ;
I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
Behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and worship before thy feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
Behold , I come quickly : hold that fast which thou hast , that no man take thy crown .
Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God , and he shall go no more out : and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , which is new Jerusalem , which cometh down out of heaven from my God : and I will write upon him my new name .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write ; These things saith the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God ;
I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot : I would thou wert cold or hot .
So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth .
Because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked :
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
As many as I love , I rebuke and chasten : be zealous therefore , and repent .
Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me .
To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with my Father in his throne .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
After this I looked , and , behold , a door was opened in heaven : and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me ; which said , Come up hither , and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter .
And immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone : and there was a rainbow round about the throne , in sight like unto an emerald .
And round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal : and in the midst of the throne , and round about the throne , were four beasts full of eyes before and behind .
And the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him ; and they were full of eyes within : and they rest not day and night , saying , Holy , holy , holy , LORD God Almighty , which was , and is , and is to come .
And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne , who liveth for ever and ever ,
The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne , and worship him that liveth for ever and ever , and cast their crowns before the throne , saying ,
Thou art worthy , O Lord , to receive glory and honour and power : for thou hast created all things , and for thy pleasure they are and were created .
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside , sealed with seven seals .
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , Who is worthy to open the book , and to loose the seals thereof ?
And no man in heaven , nor in earth , neither under the earth , was able to open the book , neither to look thereon .
And I wept much , because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book , neither to look thereon .
And one of the elders saith unto me , Weep not : behold , the Lion of the tribe of Juda , the Root of David , hath prevailed to open the book , and to loose the seven seals thereof .
And I beheld , and , lo , in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts , and in the midst of the elders , stood a Lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth .
And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne .
And when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
And they sung a new song , saying , Thou art worthy to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou wast slain , and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred , and tongue , and people , and nation ;
And hast made us unto our God kings and priests : and we shall reign on the earth .
And I beheld , and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands ;
Saying with a loud voice , Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
And every creature which is in heaven , and on the earth , and under the earth , and such as are in the sea , and all that are in them , heard I saying , Blessing , and honour , and glory , and power , be unto him that sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb for ever and ever .
And the four beasts said , Amen . And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever .
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals , and I heard , as it were the noise of thunder , one of the four beasts saying , Come and see .
And I saw , and behold a white horse : and he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown was given unto him : and he went forth conquering , and to conquer .
And when he had opened the second seal , I heard the second beast say , Come and see .
And there went out another horse that was red : and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another : and there was given unto him a great sword .
And when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . And I beheld , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
And when he had opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth beast say , Come and see .
And I looked , and behold a pale horse : and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed with him . And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with the beasts of the earth .
And when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held :
And they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , O Lord , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
And white robes were given unto every one of them ; and it was said unto them , that they should rest yet for a little season , until their fellowservants also and their brethren , that should be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood ;
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs , when she is shaken of a mighty wind .
And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
And the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains ;
And said to the mountains and rocks , Fall on us , and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb :
For the great day of his wrath is come ; and who shall be able to stand ?
And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
And I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea ,
Saying , Hurt not the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads .
And I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
After this I beheld , and , lo , a great multitude , which no man could number , of all nations , and kindreds , and people , and tongues , stood before the throne , and before the Lamb , clothed with white robes , and palms in their hands ;
And cried with a loud voice , saying , Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb .
And all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God ,
Saying , Amen : Blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thanksgiving , and honour , and power , and might , be unto our God for ever and ever . Amen .
And one of the elders answered , saying unto me , What are these which are arrayed in white robes ? and whence came they ?
And I said unto him , Sir , thou knowest . And he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
Therefore are they before the throne of God , and serve him day and night in his temple : and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them .
They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat .
For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters : and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes .
And when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour .
And I saw the seven angels which stood before God ; and to them were given seven trumpets .
And another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden censer ; and there was given unto him much incense , that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne .
And the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before God out of the angel ' s hand .
And the angel took the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voices , and thunderings , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
The first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
And the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood ;
And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
And the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters ;
And the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
And the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was darkened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
And I beheld , and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven , saying with a loud voice , Woe , woe , woe , to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels , which are yet to sound !
And the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth : and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit .
And he opened the bottomless pit ; and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
And to them it was given that they should not kill them , but that they should be tormented five months : and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion , when he striketh a man .
And in those days shall men seek death , and shall not find it ; and shall desire to die , and death shall flee from them .
And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle ; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold , and their faces were as the faces of men .
And they had hair as the hair of women , and their teeth were as the teeth of lions .
And they had breastplates , as it were breastplates of iron ; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle .
And they had tails like unto scorpions , and there were stings in their tails : and their power was to hurt men five months .
And they had a king over them , which is the angel of the bottomless pit , whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon , but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon .
One woe is past ; and , behold , there come two woes more hereafter .
And the sixth angel sounded , and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God ,
Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet , Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates .
And the four angels were loosed , which were prepared for an hour , and a day , and a month , and a year , for to slay the third part of men .
And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand : and I heard the number of them .
And thus I saw the horses in the vision , and them that sat on them , having breastplates of fire , and of jacinth , and brimstone : and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions ; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone .
By these three was the third part of men killed , by the fire , and by the smoke , and by the brimstone , which issued out of their mouths .
For their power is in their mouth , and in their tails : for their tails were like unto serpents , and had heads , and with them they do hurt .
And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands , that they should not worship devils , and idols of gold , and silver , and brass , and stone , and of wood : which neither can see , nor hear , nor walk :
Neither repented they of their murders , nor of their sorceries , nor of their fornication , nor of their thefts .
And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven , clothed with a cloud : and a rainbow was upon his head , and his face was as it were the sun , and his feet as pillars of fire :
And he had in his hand a little book open : and he set his right foot upon the sea , and his left foot on the earth ,
And cried with a loud voice , as when a lion roareth : and when he had cried , seven thunders uttered their voices .
And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices , I was about to write : and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not .
And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven ,
And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever , who created heaven , and the things that therein are , and the earth , and the things that therein are , and the sea , and the things which are therein , that there should be time no longer :
But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel , when he shall begin to sound , the mystery of God should be finished , as he hath declared to his servants the prophets .
And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again , and said , Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth .
And I went unto the angel , and said unto him , Give me the little book . And he said unto me , Take it , and eat it up ; and it shall make thy belly bitter , but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey .
And I took the little book out of the angel ' s hand , and ate it up ; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey : and as soon as I had eaten it , my belly was bitter .
And he said unto me , Thou must prophesy again before many peoples , and nations , and tongues , and kings .
And there was given me a reed like unto a rod : and the angel stood , saying , Rise , and measure the temple of God , and the altar , and them that worship therein .
But the court which is without the temple leave out , and measure it not ; for it is given unto the Gentiles : and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months .
And I will give power unto my two witnesses , and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days , clothed in sackcloth .
These are the two olive trees , and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth .
And if any man will hurt them , fire proceedeth out of their mouth , and devoureth their enemies : and if any man will hurt them , he must in this manner be killed .
These have power to shut heaven , that it rain not in the days of their prophecy : and have power over waters to turn them to blood , and to smite the earth with all plagues , as often as they will .
And when they shall have finished their testimony , the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them , and shall overcome them , and kill them .
And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city , which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt , where also our Lord was crucified .
And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half , and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves .
And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them , and make merry , and shall send gifts one to another ; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth .
And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them , and they stood upon their feet ; and great fear fell upon them which saw them .
And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them , Come up hither . And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud ; and their enemies beheld them .
And the same hour was there a great earthquake , and the tenth part of the city fell , and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand : and the remnant were affrighted , and gave glory to the God of heaven .
The second woe is past ; and , behold , the third woe cometh quickly .
And the seventh angel sounded ; and there were great voices in heaven , saying , The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord , and of his Christ ; and he shall reign for ever and ever .
And the four and twenty elders , which sat before God on their seats , fell upon their faces , and worshipped God ,
Saying , We give thee thanks , O LORD God Almighty , which art , and wast , and art to come ; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power , and hast reigned .
And the nations were angry , and thy wrath is come , and the time of the dead , that they should be judged , and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets , and to the saints , and them that fear thy name , small and great ; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth .
And the temple of God was opened in heaven , and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament : and there were lightnings , and voices , and thunderings , and an earthquake , and great hail .
And there appeared a great wonder in heaven ; a woman clothed with the sun , and the moon under her feet , and upon her head a crown of twelve stars :
And she being with child cried , travailing in birth , and pained to be delivered .
And there appeared another wonder in heaven ; and behold a great red dragon , having seven heads and ten horns , and seven crowns upon his heads .
And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast them to the earth : and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered , for to devour her child as soon as it was born .
And she brought forth a man child , who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron : and her child was caught up unto God , and to his throne .
And the woman fled into the wilderness , where she hath a place prepared of God , that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days .
And there was war in heaven : Michael and his angels fought against the dragon ; and the dragon fought and his angels ,
And prevailed not ; neither was their place found any more in heaven .
And the great dragon was cast out , that old serpent , called the Devil , and Satan , which deceiveth the whole world : he was cast out into the earth , and his angels were cast out with him .
And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , Now is come salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of his Christ : for the accuser of our brethren is cast down , which accused them before our God day and night .
And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb , and by the word of their testimony ; and they loved not their lives unto the death .
Therefore rejoice , ye heavens , and ye that dwell in them . Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ! for the devil is come down unto you , having great wrath , because he knoweth that he hath but a short time .
And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth , he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child .
And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle , that she might fly into the wilderness , into her place , where she is nourished for a time , and times , and half a time , from the face of the serpent .
And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman , that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood .
And the earth helped the woman , and the earth opened her mouth , and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth .
And the dragon was wroth with the woman , and went to make war with the remnant of her seed , which keep the commandments of God , and have the testimony of Jesus Christ .
